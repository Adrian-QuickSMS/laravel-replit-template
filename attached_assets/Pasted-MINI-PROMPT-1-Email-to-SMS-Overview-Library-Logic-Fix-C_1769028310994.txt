MINI PROMPT 1 — Email-to-SMS Overview Library Logic Fix (Customer Portal)

Context for Replit
You are working in Customer Portal → Management → Email-to-SMS.
This module already has two working sub-modules:

Email-to-SMS – Standard

Email-to-SMS – Contact List

The Overview tab must be a unified library view that aggregates data from BOTH modules.
Do not invent new logic — reuse existing data models and behaviour.

❗ Problem

The Overview Library currently:

Does not correctly reflect data from Standard and Contact List setups

Does not show the correct allowed sender email logic

Does not display the generated target email address correctly

Uses a generic view modal, instead of the correct type-specific view

✅ Required Behaviour
1. Overview Library = Aggregated View

The Overview table must be built by combining records from:

Email-to-SMS – Standard

Email-to-SMS – Contact List

No separate storage or mock data

Same records, same IDs, same state

2. “Allowed Email Addresses” Column (Critical Fix)

This column must show the allowed sender email list, NOT originating addresses.

Standard Email-to-SMS

Customer sends emails to MSISDN@sms.quicksms.com

Example: 447920099278@sms.quicksms.com

The Allowed Email Addresses column must show:

The list of approved sender email addresses configured by the customer

There is no custom domain target for Standard

Contact List Email-to-SMS

Customer sends emails to a generated address

Example: appointments-8472@sms.quicksms.com

The Allowed Email Addresses column must show:

The list of approved sender email addresses

The generated target address is NOT the allowed sender

👉 Use the same logic already implemented inside each respective tab
👉 Do not duplicate or reinterpret the rules

3. Generated Target Email Address Visibility

When a Contact List Email-to-SMS mapping is created:

The generated email address must be visible in:

Three-dot → View (from Overview)

Three-dot → View (from Contact List tab)

This address already exists — it just needs surfacing consistently.

4. View Modal Must Be Type-Specific

When clicking Three dots → View in the Overview table:

If record type = Standard

Open the Standard Email-to-SMS view layout

If record type = Contact List

Open the Contact List Email-to-SMS view layout

⚠️ Do NOT create a new generic modal
⚠️ Reuse the exact same components used in each tab

5. Table Presentation Rules

The Overview table row must visually adapt based on type:

Fields shown

Labels

Copy

Behaviour must match what users already see in:

Standard tab

Contact List tab
