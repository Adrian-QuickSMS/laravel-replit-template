ADMIN PORTAL — Sender ID Approvals: Add “Dynamic SenderID Access” Modal (Fillow, no new design)

Context:
- This is the internal Admin Control Plane page “Sender ID Approvals” (queue/table view).
- We must follow existing Fillow table/filter/button/modal styles already used in Admin.
- Do NOT redesign the page. Add only what is required.
- This feature grants an account permission to use Dynamic SenderIDs (admin-only override).

UI Change (Page):
1) Add a new secondary button in the top-right action area of the page (same row as the existing Export button).
   - Button label: “Dynamic SenderID Access”
   - Style: Fillow secondary button (admin blue theme), same height and spacing as Export.
   - Clicking it opens a standard Fillow confirmation modal (popup).

Modal: “Dynamic SenderID Access”
2) Modal layout must follow existing Fillow modal pattern used across Admin:
   - Title: “Dynamic SenderID Access”
   - Short helper text (1–2 lines):
     “Grant an account permission to use Dynamic SenderIDs. This is an admin override and is fully audited.”

3) Fields (Required):
   A) Account (required)
   - Searchable dropdown (typeahead) listing all customer accounts by:
     - Primary label: Company/Client Name
     - Secondary small text: Account ID / Account number
   - Selecting an account drives the Sub-account options.

   B) Scope (required, radio buttons):
   - “All sub-accounts”
   - “Specific sub-account(s)”

   C) Sub-accounts (conditional)
   - Only visible when “Specific sub-account(s)” is selected.
   - Multi-select dropdown listing sub-accounts for the chosen account.
   - If account changes, clear selected sub-accounts.

4) Optional Field:
   D) Internal note (optional)
   - Textarea
   - Placeholder: “Reason for granting dynamic SenderID access (optional)”
   - This note is internal-only.

Modal Actions:
5) Footer buttons:
   - Left: “Cancel” (Fillow secondary/ghost, no new colours)
   - Right (primary CTA): “Grant Access” (Fillow primary button in admin blue)

Behaviour:
6) Validation:
   - Account is mandatory.
   - Scope is mandatory.
   - If scope = specific sub-accounts, at least one sub-account must be selected.
   - Inline validation errors under fields using existing Fillow form validation style.

7) On “Grant Access”:
   - Call a backend-ready service function (mock if endpoint not available yet):
     POST /admin/accounts/{accountId}/dynamic-senderid
     payload:
     {
       "scope": "ALL_SUBACCOUNTS" | "SPECIFIC_SUBACCOUNTS",
       "subAccountIds": [],
       "note": ""
     }
   - If backend not implemented, create a mock service layer that returns success and is easy to replace later.

8) Success:
   - Show standard Fillow success toast: “Dynamic SenderID access granted.”
   - Close modal.
   - (No table redesign required.) If the table already supports re-fetch, trigger a data refresh; otherwise leave as-is.

9) Failure:
   - Show standard Fillow error toast: “Could not grant access. Please try again.”
   - Keep modal open and preserve user selections.

Audit Logging (Mandatory):
10) Emit an admin audit event on success:
   - Event Type: “dynamic_senderid_access_granted”
   - Fields: adminUserId, accountId, scope, subAccountIds (if any), timestamp, ipAddress, note (if provided)

Constraints:
- Reuse existing components (Dropdowns, Multi-select, Modal, Toast) from the Admin Fillow implementation.
- Do NOT introduce new colours, badges, icons, or page sections.
- Keep spacing/alignment consistent with the current “Export” control area.
