Purchase → Numbers — UI & Behaviour Changes (Match Purchase → Messages Exactly)

Goal:
Restore design consistency with Purchase → Messages cards (Starter package style). Reuse the same components/styles. Do NOT invent new UI patterns.

────────────────────────
A) Remove type pills; keep ONLY “Best value” pill for UK VMN
────────────────────────
Current issue:
- Pills/badges like “Long Code”, “Shared”, “Dedicated” are showing.

Requirement:
- Remove ALL type/category pills/badges (“Long Code”, “Shared”, “Dedicated”, etc.) from the tiles/cards.
- Only show a “Best value” pill, and ONLY on:
  - UK Virtual Mobile Number
- The “Best value” pill must look exactly the same as the one used on Purchase → Messages (Starter package).

Constraints:
- Do not add any other pills.
- Match the existing pill styling (rounded, padding, font, pastel/purple as per template).

Acceptance Criteria:
- No type pills remain anywhere.
- UK VMN shows the “Best value” pill identical to Purchase → Messages.

────────────────────────
B) CTA button styling: “Select” must be primary purple
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- The CTA button on the tiles/cards (“Select”) must use the same purple primary button styling as Purchase → Messages.
- Same colour, hover state, border radius, and sizing.

Constraints:
- Reuse the existing primary button component.
- Do not create new colours.

Acceptance Criteria:
- “Select” button is visually identical to the primary button used in Purchase → Messages.

────────────────────────
C) Remove “Assign to sub-account” dropdown entirely
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Remove the assign-to-sub-account dropdown from the purchase flow UI for now.
- Purchase selection should not ask for sub-account assignment in this module.

Constraints:
- Do not show assignment anywhere on this page.
- Keep the purchase confirmation modal focused only on items selected and costs.

Acceptance Criteria:
- No sub-account dropdown appears on Purchase → Numbers (cards, tables, modals).

────────────────────────
D) Use mock pricing data: Setup + Monthly costs = £2 for UK VMN and UK Shared Short Code
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Use mock data pricing values:
  - UK Virtual Mobile Number:
    • Setup cost = £2
    • Monthly cost = £2
  - UK Shared Short Code:
    • Setup cost = £2
    • Monthly cost = £2
- These should mirror the Purchase → Messages “Starter package” visual pricing style.

Constraints:
- This is mock data only (do not wire HubSpot yet in this change).
- Display currency as £.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Both tiles show Setup and Monthly costs as £2 using the same badge formatting as Purchase → Messages.
- No other price labels or variants are shown.
