STRONG GUARDRAIL PROMPT — QUICKSMS ADMIN PORTAL (READ CAREFULLY)

You are building the QuickSMS Admin Portal (internal employee console). The Admin Portal is a SUPERSET of the customer portal, NOT a sibling UI and NOT a parallel system.

NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES (DO NOT VIOLATE):
1) DO NOT rebuild modules, pages, components, or logic that already exist in the customer portal.
   - Admin must REUSE the exact same components and rendering logic wherever possible.
   - Admin may only “wrap” existing components with admin-only scope, filters, and permissions.

2) SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH:
   - All definitions and calculations (parts, delivery, pending, rejected, billable, cost, revenue, margin, status mappings) MUST match the customer portal EXACTLY.
   - Admin has broader visibility (cross-client), but MUST NOT invent new metric definitions, new statuses, new delivery mappings, or new billing logic.
   - Any server-side aggregates must use the same warehouse definitions used by customer reporting.

3) DESIGN SYSTEM:
   - Use ONLY the Fillow template components, spacing, typography, table styling, pills/badges, modals, and cards.
   - Do NOT introduce new UI patterns, iconography, table styles, button styles, headers, or colour systems.
   - The ONLY permitted design change is theme colour: Admin uses BLUE tones (instead of customer purple) to visually distinguish admin vs customer.
   - All other styling must remain Fillow-standard.

4) SHARED COMPONENT RULE:
   - If a component exists in customer portal (tables, filters with Apply, drill-down behaviour, preview components, etc.), import/reuse it.
   - If changes are required, refactor the shared component ONCE and ensure BOTH admin + customer portals inherit the improvement automatically.

5) FILTER & DRILL BEHAVIOUR:
   - Filters MUST NOT auto-apply. Every filter panel must have “Apply Filters” and “Reset”.
   - Drill-down must pass the active filters into the target module (Message Log / Client Reporting / Supplier Reporting).
   - Maximum drill depth: 1 level deep from the dashboard (no infinite nested drill trees).

6) SECURITY / DATA PROTECTION:
   - Admin portal is INTERNAL ONLY. It must be impossible to access from customer routes.
   - Phone numbers and message content are masked by default.
   - Any “reveal” of sensitive data must be an explicit action and must create an admin audit log entry.
   - Supplier pricing, supplier cost, and margin data must NEVER be exposed to customer views or shared components that can render in customer routes.

IMPLEMENTATION EXPECTATION:
- Before creating any new UI, search the codebase for an existing equivalent in the customer portal (Reporting dashboard, KPI tiles, tables, filters, status pills, drill behaviour).
- Reuse and compose existing components first.
- Only create new components when there is no existing equivalent AND the UI is admin-only (e.g., Supplier Route Health tiles, Margin Risk tables) — and even then, build them using Fillow components and the same styling rules.

DELIVERABLE FOR THIS ITERATION:
- Admin Dashboard page using Fillow layout and existing reporting components:
  - Global Filters (Apply/Reset, no auto-filter)
  - Financial KPI tiles
  - Delivery KPI tiles
  - Platform Reporting charts (reuse the same components as customer reporting, but scoped cross-client)
  - Admin-only sections (Supplier Route Health, UK Network & Porting Health, Margin Risk)
- Admin uses BLUE theme, but keeps Fillow UI patterns unchanged.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (MUST PASS):
- No duplicated logic for delivery statuses, parts, billing, margin, or reporting metrics.
- No new table styles, header styles, badge styles, or button patterns introduced.
- Filters only apply on “Apply Filters”.
- Drill-down passes filter state correctly.
- Admin-only data (supplier cost/margin) cannot appear in customer routes under any circumstances.
