You are working on my QuickSMS portal UI (Tailwind-based admin template). On 14–15" widescreen laptops the page feels too stretched and “floaty”. I want a proper, repeatable layout fix.

GOAL
Implement a consistent “desktop container” layout so content doesn’t span the full viewport width. Use a max-width centered container for the main content area while keeping the left sidebar full height.

TARGET BREAKPOINTS
- Laptop baseline: 1366x768 and 1440x900 must look balanced.
- Large screens should not keep stretching content infinitely.

WHAT TO CHANGE (DO THIS FIRST ON THE ‘Send Message’ page)
1) Add a main content container:
   - main content should be centered with max-width: 1280px (or 1200–1280)
   - add horizontal padding: px-6 (mobile smaller)
   - keep the existing sidebar and topbar, but constrain the page content inside the container.

2) Convert the main page layout to a responsive 2-column grid:
   - Left column (form): flex-1, minimum comfortable width.
   - Right column (Message Preview): fixed-ish width (e.g. 420–480px) and should NOT expand beyond that.
   - On smaller widths (<1024px), stack into 1 column (preview below).

3) Make preview more usable:
   - On desktop (lg and up), make the preview column sticky with top offset under the header (e.g. top-24).
   - Ensure the preview card height doesn’t exceed viewport: use max-h and internal scrolling if needed.

4) Ensure spacing and rhythm:
   - Use consistent vertical spacing between cards (gap-6)
   - Prevent cards and inputs from becoming too wide:
     - apply max-w to long single inputs (like campaign name) if needed.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Find the page component/template for “Send Message” and the shared layout wrapper (where sidebar + topbar are defined).
- Introduce a reusable CSS/Tailwind utility:
  - container class like: mx-auto w-full max-w-[1280px] px-6
- Apply it to page content area on this page first, then make it the default for all pages using the same layout.

DELIVERABLES
- Show me the exact files changed.
- Provide the Tailwind class changes and any new wrapper components.
- After changes, add a quick note: what to adjust if I want max width 1200 or 1440 instead.

IMPORTANT
Do not visually redesign colours or components. This is purely a layout + responsiveness fix.
