Fix the following specific issues in the Inbox / Messages screen. No redesign, only wiring and layout fixes.

────────────────────────
A) FILTERS — MUST WORK

The following filters in the conversation list are NOT working and must be fully functional:

1. Status filter:
   - All
   - Unread
   - SMS
   - RCS

Expected behaviour:
- All → show all conversations.
- Unread → only threads with at least one unread message.
- SMS → only conversations where the latest message is SMS.
- RCS → only conversations where the latest message is RCS.

2. Source filter:
   - All Sources
   - Specific Short Codes
   - Specific VMNs
   - Specific RCS Agents

Expected behaviour:
- All Sources → no source restriction.
- Specific Short Codes → show only conversations associated with the selected shortcode(s).
- Specific VMNs → show only conversations associated with the selected VMN(s).
- Specific RCS Agents → show only conversations associated with the selected RCS agent(s).

Implementation notes:
- Ensure the filter logic actually filters the list data (even if using mock data).
- Combining Status + Source filters should work (AND logic, not OR).
- If the data model uses different field names, map filters correctly to those fields.

────────────────────────
B) SEARCH BAR IN CHAT LIST — MUST WORK

The search bar above the conversation list must be functional.

Requirements:
- Search should filter the conversation list by:
  - Contact name
  - Mobile number

Behaviour:
- Typing in the search box should update the visible list to only show matching conversations.
- Case-insensitive match is fine.
- Clearing the search box restores the full list.
- Do NOT search message content here – only name and number.

────────────────────────
C) MESSAGE BUBBLE WIDTH — MAKE IT FEEL LIKE IPHONE / ANDROID / WHATSAPP

Current issue:
- Message bubbles (both customer and user) are still too narrow and do not look like typical chat apps.

Required behaviour:
- Both inbound (customer) and outbound (user) bubbles should:
  - Expand up to roughly 3/5 (60–70%) of the chat area width.
  - Only wrap/appear narrower if:
    - The message itself is very short, or
    - There are explicit line breaks.

Implementation hints:
- Remove or relax any restrictive width classes (e.g. `max-w-xs` or very small fixed widths).
- Use a responsive max-width based on the chat container (e.g. `max-w-[60%]` or equivalent).
- Ensure this logic is applied consistently to all message bubbles (SMS and RCS).

Goal:
- Visually, bubbles should feel similar to iPhone/Android/WhatsApp width behaviour, not cramped.

────────────────────────
D) THREE-DOT MENU — ADD “MARK AS UNREAD”

Current behaviour:
- The three-dot menu in the chat header only has “Mark as read” (or equivalent).

Required update:
- Add an additional option: “Mark as unread”.

Behaviour:
- When “Mark as unread” is selected:
  - The conversation is flagged as unread.
  - The unread notification icon/dot reappears in the conversation list.
  - The conversation appears in the “Unread” filter results.
- This should update the front-end state and work with the existing filters.
- You can stub backend integration with TODOs if required, but the UI state must update correctly.

────────────────────────
Constraints:
- Do NOT redesign the UI.
- Reuse existing components and styling patterns.
- Limit changes to:
  - Inbox/Messages conversation list
  - Filters/search logic
  - Bubble layout
  - Three-dot menu actions

────────────────────────
Acceptance checklist:
- Status filter (All / Unread / SMS / RCS) works correctly.
- Source filter (All Sources / Specific Short Codes / Specific VMNs / Specific RCS Agents) works correctly.
- Search bar filters conversations by name or mobile number and is clearly working.
- Message bubbles expand up to ~3/5 of the chat width and no longer appear as very narrow columns.
- “Mark as unread” appears in the three-dot menu and correctly restores the unread state + notification icon in the list.
