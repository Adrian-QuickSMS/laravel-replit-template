Message Templates — Version History Popup Redesign + Proper Mock Data + Rollback Demo

Goal:
Bring the Version History popup back in line with platform design principles (simple, table-first, no unnecessary banners/pills) and include mock data that demonstrates multi-version templates and rollback behaviour.

────────────────────────
A) Remove the grey top banner and unnecessary pills
────────────────────────
Requirements:
- Remove the entire grey banner/header area currently shown at the top of the Version History popup.
- Do NOT render:
  - Template ID as a pill
  - “Current v1” pill
  - “Draft” pill in the banner
- Keep the header minimal:
  - Title: “Version History”
  - Optional subtitle: “Template: {Template Name} (ID: 12345678)” as plain text only

Constraints:
- No coloured pills in the header.
- Use standard modal header styling used across the portal.

Acceptance:
- No grey banner area exists.
- Template ID is plain text (not a pill).
- No “current v1” or “draft” pills appear in the header.

────────────────────────
B) Version list must show every version row (table-first)
────────────────────────
Requirements:
- Display all versions in a table/list with one row per version (v1, v2, v3…).
- Columns (plain text, no pills except if you keep Status elsewhere—prefer plain text here):
  - Version (e.g. v1, v2, v3)
  - Edited By
  - Edited At (date/time)
  - Change Summary (optional)
  - Status (plain text: Draft / Live / Archived)
  - Actions (buttons/links)

Design rules:
- “v1” must be plain text.
- Do NOT show “Current” pills in the table.
- If you need to indicate the active version, use subtle plain text like “(active)” or a small icon—not a pill.

Constraints:
- Use the same table typography + spacing as other list popups (Message Logs/Downloads style).
- No badge/pill styling for version/channel/preview.

Acceptance:
- Every version is visible as its own row.
- No “Current” pill appears.
- Version labels are plain text (v1/v2/v3).

────────────────────────
C) Add mock data that demonstrates multi-version templates
────────────────────────
Requirements:
- Update mock data so at least 2 templates have multiple versions:
  - Template A: v1, v2, v3
  - Template B: v1, v2
  - Template C: v1 only
- Each version must have different timestamps and “edited by” values so the list feels realistic.

Constraints:
- Mock versions must load based on the template selected from the three-dot menu (no static single list that ignores templateId).

Acceptance:
- Opening Version History for different templates shows different version counts.

────────────────────────
D) Rollback must be demonstrable and visibly changes current content
────────────────────────
Requirements:
- Implement rollback UI that can be validated with mock data:
  - Each version row has an action: “Roll back”
  - Clicking Roll back opens a confirmation modal:
    “Roll back to v2? This will create a new version (v4) using v2 content.”
  - On confirm:
    - Create a NEW version (next version number) with the selected version’s payload
    - Mark it as the active version (and Live if template is Live)
    - Refresh the version table so user can immediately see the new version row

Additionally:
- Provide a “View version” action per row to open a read-only preview of that version’s content (so rollback makes sense).

Constraints:
- Rollback must not overwrite existing versions.
- Must never be silent—show success toast/message:
  “Rollback complete. Created v4 from v2.”

Acceptance:
- With mock data, I can roll back v3 to v1 and see a new version created immediately.
- “View version” lets me verify different content between versions.
- Rollback confirmation and success feedback are visible.
