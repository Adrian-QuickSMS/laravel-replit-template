RCS Wizard — URL Image Editing Save Flow (Required)

When a user uses a publicly accessible image URL (not an uploaded file) and then edits the image (zoom/crop/pan/orientation), add an explicit SAVE step and an unsaved-changes warning.

1) Detect unsaved edits (“dirty state”)
Mark the image as UNSAVED if the user changes ANY of:
- zoom level
- crop box
- pan/position
- orientation (short/medium)
- any editor setting that affects how the image is presented

2) Show a “Save” button (URL images only)
If the image source is a URL and dirty state = true:
- Show a clear “Save” button in the editor UI (near zoom/crop controls).
- Disable or hide the Save button when there are no changes.
- Keep styling consistent with existing template buttons (do not invent new styles).

3) Save confirmation pop-up on navigation/continue/close
If dirty state = true and the user attempts to:
- continue to the next wizard step,
- switch cards in a carousel,
- close the wizard/editor,
- change message type,
- navigate away,
show a modal with the following content:

Title: Save image changes?
Body (exact meaning, wording can be polished but must include both points):
- “You have made changes to how the image has been presented. Do you want to save?”
- “If you save, QuickSMS will create a unique URL on a quicksms.com domain to replace the URL you provided.”
- “If you don’t save, the image will render using the default (original URL and default presentation).”

Buttons:
- Primary: Save changes
- Secondary: Don’t save
- Tertiary: Cancel (stay on editor)

4) Save behaviour (creates QuickSMS-hosted URL)
When the user clicks “Save changes”:
- Fetch the original image server-side.
- Apply the edits (crop/zoom/position/orientation).
- Store the resulting edited image to a publicly accessible QuickSMS-hosted URL on a quicksms.com domain.
- Replace the original URL in the draft RCS payload with the new QuickSMS URL.
- Update the phone preview to render from the QuickSMS URL.
- Clear dirty state.

Validation:
- Apply existing RCS media validation rules (type, size limit, dimensions) to the saved image.
- If validation fails, show inline error and do not save.

5) Don’t save behaviour (reverts to default rendering)
When the user clicks “Don’t save”:
- Discard the edits.
- Revert preview and payload to the original URL and default presentation (no custom crop/zoom).
- Clear dirty state.
- Continue with navigation.

Constraints:
- Do not allow the user to proceed while dirty unless they choose Save changes or Don’t save.
- If edits were saved, the final payload must NOT reference the third-party URL; it must reference the QuickSMS URL.
- Keep all UI consistent with existing template modals and buttons.

Acceptance criteria:
- URL-based image edits trigger Save button and unsaved-changes modal.
- Saving generates a unique quicksms.com URL and replaces the provided URL.
- Not saving results in default rendering from the original URL (no edits).
