Download Area — Restore Template Design Principles (Match Message Logs)

Goal:
Bring the Reporting → Download Area UI back in line with existing platform design standards, specifically matching Message Logs (filters + actions + table styling). Do not introduce new UI patterns.

────────────────────────
A) Filters: Positioning, colour, and layout must match Message Logs
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Restore filter button positioning and colours to be identical to Message Logs.
  - “ Filters” must be in the same location and use the same button styles as Message Logs.
- Filter container background must use the same pastel purple styling used elsewhere in Reporting filters.
- Do not change spacing/padding conventions compared to Message Logs.

Constraints:
- Reuse existing filter component + styles used in Message Logs (do not create new CSS variants).

Acceptance:
- Filter panel visually matches Message Logs (button placement, colour, spacing, background).

────────────────────────
B) Dropdown controls: Multi-select where specified
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Update dropdowns to support multi-select where required by the PRD:
  - Sub-Account: multi-select
  - User: multi-select
  - Module: single-select is OK unless otherwise stated, but keep consistent with PRD
- Ensure selected values render as the same style used across the platform (consistent chips/tokens).

Constraints:
- Use the same multi-select dropdown component already used elsewhere (e.g. Message Logs / Finance Data).
- Do not invent a new dropdown behaviour.

Acceptance:
- Sub-Account and User filters support multi-select with consistent UX.

────────────────────────
C) Status column: Add coloured pastel pills (Completed / Failed)
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Replace plain status text with pastel-coloured pills (tags) for clarity:
  - Completed → pastel green pill
  - Failed → pastel red pill
  (Optional future: Running/Queued etc, but not required now)
- Pill styling must match the existing tag/list pill formatting used elsewhere in the platform (rounded edges, padding, font weight).

Constraints:
- Use existing pill component styles (do not introduce new pill variants).
- Keep table readable and consistent with template typography.

Acceptance:
- Status shows as rounded pastel pills.
- Pill styling matches existing tag/list pills across the platform.

────────────────────────
D) Bulk actions: Buttons next to filters when rows are selected
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Add multi-select checkboxes per row (and select-all in header if supported).
- When 1+ rows are selected, show bulk action buttons next to the filter controls (same row/area as Message Logs actions):
  - Download selected
  - Delete selected (if role permitted)
- Buttons must appear/disappear dynamically based on selection state.

Constraints:
- Do not place bulk action buttons inside the table header if Message Logs pattern uses filter-area actions.
- Respect RBAC:
  - Delete/Archive visible only for Admin (or configured role).

Acceptance:
- Selecting rows reveals bulk action buttons beside the filters.
- Actions work on all selected rows.
- Button style/placement matches Message Logs.

────────────────────────
Regression checklist
────────────────────────
- Filter styling, background, and button placement matches Message Logs exactly.
- Sub-Account and User filters are multi-select.
- Status uses pastel pills (not plain text).
- Bulk action buttons appear next to filters when rows selected.
