Fix and generalise the drill-down behaviour on the Finance Data page.

A) All months must be drillable (ignore billing status)

- Every Billing Month row in the primary table must be drillable, regardless of Billing Status.
- Do NOT block drill-down for Provisional, Finalised, or Adjusted months.
- If any condition disables drill based on billingStatus, remove it.
- Drill availability must be controlled ONLY by user interaction (not status).

B) Drill order must be chosen by the user (NOT hard-coded)

Current issue:
- Drill is effectively hard-coded to “Month → Day → Sub Account → Country”.

Required behaviour:
- The user can choose the drill order dynamically.

Implementation model:

1. Base level
   - Level 0 row granularity = Billing Month (top-level table).

2. Drill dimension selector
   - Provide a control (e.g. dropdown or buttons) labelled “Drill by…”.
   - Available dimensions:
     * Day
     * Sub Account
     * Country
     * Sender ID
     * Product Type
     * Group Name

3. First drill:
   - User selects a drill dimension (e.g. Day, or Sub Account, or Country, etc.).
   - When the user clicks a Billing Month row:
     * Drill into that month using the selected dimension as the next row granularity.
     * Example: if “Day” is chosen → Month → Day.
       If “Sub Account” is chosen → Month → Sub Account.

4. Further drills:
   - After drilling once, the user can choose an additional drill dimension from the remaining options.
   - Drill path must support any order, for example:
     * Month → Day → Sub Account
     * Month → Sub Account → Country
     * Month → Sender ID → Country
   - When a new dimension is chosen and a row at the current level is clicked, add that dimension to the drill path.

C) Layout examples (for how the table should render)

Example 1 – User path: Month → Day
- User selects “Day” as drill dimension, then clicks “September 2025”.

Table should show:
- Top summary row:
  “September 2025 (Totals for all columns)”
- Then one row per day:
  01/09/2025
  02/09/2025
  03/09/2025
  ...
  30/09/2025

Columns stay the same at each row:
- Billable Parts
- Non-Billable Parts
- Total Parts
- Total Cost (ex VAT)
- Billing Status

Example 2 – User path: Month → Day → Sub Account
- After drilling to Day level, user chooses “Sub Account” as next drill dimension.
- When they drill again:

Table structure:
September 2025 (Totals)

01/09/2025 (Day total)
    Sub Account 1
    Sub Account 2
02/09/2025 (Day total)
    Sub Account 1
    Sub Account 3
...

Each Sub Account row has the same columns:
- Billable Parts
- Non-Billable Parts
- Total Parts
- Total Cost (ex VAT)
- Billing Status (if applicable to that grouping)

Example 3 – User path: Month → Day → Sub Account → Country
- At Sub Account level, user selects “Country” as next drill dimension and drills again.

Layout:
September 2025 (Totals)

01/09/2025
  Sub Account 1
      UK
      Germany
  Sub Account 2
      UK
      Germany

02/09/2025
  Sub Account 1
      UK
  Sub Account 3
      UK
      Ireland

Again, columns remain:
- Billable Parts
- Non-Billable Parts
- Total Parts
- Total Cost (ex VAT)
- Billing Status

D) Breadcrumb & export behaviour

Breadcrumb:
- Must reflect the actual, dynamic drill path the user has chosen.
- Example:
  Finance Data → September 2025 → Day → Sub Account → Country

- Clicking any breadcrumb level returns the table to that granularity (keeping filters).

Export:
- When exporting, ALWAYS export the current table view:
  * Same drill path
  * Same filters
  * Same columns and order

E) Constraints

- Do NOT hard-code the drill order.
- Do NOT remove drill capability for Finalised months.
- Do NOT add charts or visualisations; Finance Data is table-only.
- Reuse the existing table design and contextual styling (green/purple/red etc.).
