CRITICAL: Template Creation has broken the shared Send Message implementation.
This must be corrected before any further feature work.

Issue Summary:
The “Send Message” screen used during Template Creation is visibly broken and does NOT match the core Send Message experience. This indicates the shared Send Message builder has either:
- been partially copied,
- overridden with custom layout rules, or
- redesigned instead of reused.

This is NOT acceptable. Template creation must use the SAME Send Message builder, layout, and components, with configuration flags only.

────────────────────────
A) Enforce shared Send Message builder usage
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- The Template Creation flow MUST reuse the existing Send Message screen as a shared component.
- No custom layout, no alternate JSX, no re-styled containers.

Implementation rule (non-negotiable):
- Use a single SendMessageBuilder component with a mode flag:
  mode = "campaign" | "inbox" | "template"
- The mode flag may:
  - hide recipients
  - hide pricing
  - change final CTA label
- The mode flag must NOT:
  - change layout
  - change component positioning
  - remove feature cards

If a separate implementation exists for templates, REMOVE IT.

Acceptance:
- Diff between Campaign Send Message and Template Send Message is limited strictly to hidden sections, not layout changes.

────────────────────────
B) Fix Phone Preview + Right Pane
────────────────────────
Current issues:
- Phone preview is missing from the right pane.
- SMS/RCS toggle is floating above the layout instead of being anchored in its card.

Requirements:
- Restore the right-hand preview pane EXACTLY as per Send Message:
  - Phone preview always visible
  - Preview uses shared preview component
- SMS / Basic RCS / Rich RCS toggle must live inside the Channel / Sender card, not floating.

Acceptance:
- Preview pane renders identically to Send Message.
- Channel toggle placement matches Send Message pixel-for-pixel.

────────────────────────
C) Fix Channel / Sender Card Height
────────────────────────
Issue:
- Channel + Sender card is excessively tall and breaks visual hierarchy.

Requirement:
- Revert Channel / Sender card to the SAME dimensions and spacing used in Send Message.
- SenderID dropdown (SMS) and Agent dropdown (RCS) must appear inline and collapse correctly when not applicable.

Acceptance:
- Card height matches Send Message.
- No excessive vertical whitespace.

────────────────────────
D) Restore missing feature cards (must exist in Template mode)
────────────────────────
The following features are MISSING and must be restored:

1) Include Trackable Link toggle
2) Message Expiry toggle
3) Opt-out Management card

Rules:
- These must be visible in Template Creation.
- Behaviour should match Send Message exactly.
- Any send-time-only logic can be disabled later, but UI must exist.

Constraints:
- Do NOT remove cards in template mode.
- Do NOT replace with placeholders.

Acceptance:
- Trackable link, expiry, and opt-out cards are visible and configurable.
- UI parity with Send Message is restored.

────────────────────────
E) Explicit regression guard
────────────────────────
Add a regression note for developers:

- Template Creation is a CONFIGURATION of Send Message, not a new screen.
- Any future Send Message UI changes must automatically reflect in Template Creation.

Acceptance:
- Developer confirms (in comments or commit message) that Send Message builder is shared.
