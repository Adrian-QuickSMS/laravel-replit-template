Fix design and layout inconsistencies in the Inbox / Messages module. Use existing UI components and styles from the Messages and Contact Book templates. Do NOT redesign or introduce new visual systems.

────────────────────────
A) Conversation list (left column) – width, spacing, pills

1) Make the conversation list wider
- Increase the width of the left column so the content has more breathing room.
- Ensure there is enough horizontal padding between:
  - Contact name
  - SMS/RCS pill
  - Timestamp
  - Unread notification circle

2) SMS/RCS pill styling
- The SMS/RCS channel indicators in the conversation list must be:
  - Presented as pills/badges
  - With clearly rounded edges (fully pill-shaped, not sharp rectangles)
- Keep the previously-defined colours:
  - SMS pill = green
  - RCS pill = blue
- Ensure they align neatly and do not crowd the text.

3) VMN/Short Code/RCS Agent filter dropdown
- The arrow/chevron for the filter dropdown must not overlap the text.
- Fix the layout so the arrow sits correctly aligned to the right, like other selects in the template.
- Options in this filter must list:
  - The actual numbers or agent names on the account
  - Followed by a label in brackets indicating type, e.g.:
    - "07123 456789 (VMN)"
    - "60777 (Short Code)"
    - "Acme Banking Bot (RCS Agent)"

────────────────────────
B) Chat thread header – “To” and channel text

In the chat thread heading (where contact name, avatar and masked mobile number appear):

1) Channel text format
- Remove the icon currently used next to VMN/Short Code/RCS Agent.
- Change wording from “From” to “To”.
- Show the destination like:
  - “To 60777 (Short Code)”
  - “To 07123 456789 (VMN)”
  - “To Acme Banking Bot (RCS Agent)”

2) Typography
- The “To …” text should match the contact name in:
  - Font family
  - Font size
  - Weight
- It should visually feel like part of the same heading hierarchy, not secondary tiny metadata.

3) SMS/RCS pill in header
- SMS/RCS pill in the header should:
  - Use the same green/blue pill styling as the conversation list
  - Have rounded/pill edges

────────────────────────
C) Chat thread message bubbles – colours and width

1) Bubble colours
- Message bubbles should NOT be purple.
- They must use:
  - Green background for SMS messages
  - Blue background for RCS messages
- Ensure text is readable (white or dark text depending on contrast) and consistent with the template.

2) Bubble width
- Inbound/customer bubbles are currently too narrow (often one word per line).
- Increase the maximum width for bubbles to a sensible value (e.g. around 65–75% of the chat pane width) so messages wrap naturally and are easy to read.

────────────────────────
D) Avatar styling everywhere – match Contact Book

Avatar styling must be consistent with Contact Book across:

- Conversation list (left column)
- Chat thread (next to messages, where used)
- Chat thread header
- Contact details (right sidebar)

Requirements:
- Purple circular background (same purple used for brand/accent in the template).
- White initials text, bold.
- Initials must be perfectly centered both vertically and horizontally.
- Reuse the same avatar component or styles from Contact Book, rather than duplicating logic.

────────────────────────
E) Channel & Sender selector – standardised purple theme

The Channel selector and Sender selector components used in:
- Inbox mini composer
- Send Message screen

Currently change colour depending on channel selection. Change this:

- All Channel and Sender selector controls (the selector UI itself, not the SMS/RCS pills) must use the standard purple styling consistently, regardless of the selected channel.
- Only the SMS/RCS pills and message bubbles should use green/blue channel colours.
- Ensure this is applied identically on both:
  - Inbox composer
  - Send Message screen

────────────────────────
Constraints

- Reuse existing components and styles from Messages and Contact Book (avatar, pills, dropdowns).
- Do NOT introduce new colour tokens or fonts.
- Do NOT change global layout structure beyond widening the conversation list and fixing spacing.
- Limit changes strictly to: Inbox/Messages UI and shared components for avatars, pills, filters, and selectors.

────────────────────────
Acceptance checklist

- Conversation list column is wider with good spacing between pills, timestamps, and unread badges.
- VMN/Short Code/RCS Agent filter shows values like “60777 (Short Code)” with a correctly positioned arrow.
- Chat thread header shows “To … (VMN/Short Code/RCS Agent)” with the same typography as the contact name, no extra icon.
- SMS/RCS pills are green/blue with rounded edges in both the list and header.
- Bubbles are green for SMS, blue for RCS, with sensible widths.
- Avatars in all three locations are purple circles with centered white initials, matching Contact Book.
- Channel/Sender selector components are consistently purple on both Inbox and Send Message screens.
