There are THREE interconnected issues with dropdown menus (three dots) in all Email-to-SMS tables causing them to be clipped and overlap.

FILE: resources/views/quicksms/management/email-to-sms.blade.php

PROBLEMS:
1. Dropdown menus are partially hidden/clipped by table boundaries
2. When clicking from one dropdown to another, the previous menu doesn't close
3. Multiple dropdowns stack on top of each other

ROOT CAUSES:
1. The last table column uses "position: sticky" (lines 140-142, 156-158) which creates a stacking context that traps dropdown menus
2. Tables are wrapped in ".table-responsive" divs which add "overflow-x: auto" that clips dropdowns
3. No explicit JavaScript closes other dropdowns when opening a new one

SOLUTION APPROACH:
You must fix ALL THREE issues together - fixing one alone won't work.

FIX #1: Make dropdowns render outside table structure
Add data-bs-container="body" to ALL dropdown buttons so menus append to body instead of table cells.

FIND all instances of:
<button class="action-menu-btn" type="button" data-bs-toggle="dropdown" onclick="event.stopPropagation();">

CHANGE TO:
<button class="action-menu-btn" type="button" data-bs-toggle="dropdown" data-bs-container="body" onclick="event.stopPropagation();">

LOCATIONS:
- Line 2575 (Overview/Addresses table)
- Line 2631 (Reporting Groups table)  
- Line 2776 (Contact Lists table)
- Line 4516 (Standard library table)

FIX #2: Override table-responsive overflow for dropdown columns
Add this CSS after line 170 (after the .api-table tbody tr:hover rule):

.api-table tbody td:last-child {
    overflow: visible !important;
}
.api-table-container,
.table-responsive {
    overflow: visible !important;
}

FIX #3: Add JavaScript to explicitly close other dropdowns
Add this code inside $(document).ready() block (around line 1970, after the EMAIL_DOMAIN variable):

// Close all other dropdowns when opening a new one
$(document).on('show.bs.dropdown', '.action-menu-btn', function() {
    $('.action-menu-btn').not(this).each(function() {
        var dropdown = bootstrap.Dropdown.getInstance(this);
        if (dropdown) {
            dropdown.hide();
        }
    });
});

WHY THIS WORKS:
- data-bs-container="body" moves dropdown rendering outside the clipping context
- CSS override allows dropdowns to extend beyond table boundaries
- JavaScript ensures only one dropdown is open at a time

TESTING:
1. Go to Management > Email-to-SMS > Overview tab
2. Click three dots on row 1 - dropdown should be fully visible
3. Click three dots on row 2 - row 1's dropdown should close automatically
4. Scroll table horizontally - three dots column should stay in place (sticky)
5. Dropdown should still be fully visible when scrolling
6. Repeat for Contact Lists tab and Standard tab

CRITICAL:
- You MUST make ALL THREE fixes
- Do NOT remove "position: sticky" from the last column
- Do NOT remove ".table-responsive" wrapper
- Test that horizontal scrolling still works after the fixes
