Final refinements + bug fixes for Inbox / Messages screen. Use the existing Messages + Send Message UI templates only. Do NOT redesign.

A) Composer rules (Basic RCS requires SMS fallback sender)
- If Basic RCS is selected, the user MUST still select an SMS SenderID/Reply-from number for SMS fallback.
- UI behaviour:
  - Basic RCS selected → show BOTH:
    1) RCS Agent dropdown (Send as)
    2) SMS SenderID dropdown (SMS fallback)
- Rich RCS selected → follow existing Send Message logic (RCS agent required; include SMS fallback sender only if your send model requires fallback).
- SMS selected → SMS sender only.

B) Composer must be fixed (no page scrolling to send)
- Under no circumstances should the user need to scroll the page to access sending controls.
- The entire composer card (channel picker + sender dropdown(s) + template + AI + editor + send button) must be FIXED / STICKY at the bottom of the viewport.
- Scrolling must be confined to:
  - Left inbox conversation list column, and/or
  - Central chat history pane
- The main page container should NOT scroll for messaging.

Acceptance:
- On small laptop height, Send controls are always visible without scrolling.

C) Bugs / UI issues to fix

1) Contact overview collapse bug
- When the Contact overview (right column) is hidden/collapsed, it currently reappears at the bottom-left of the page.
- Fix so that collapsing:
  - removes/hides the right column cleanly
  - expands the central chat pane horizontally
  - does NOT move the panel elsewhere in the DOM/layout
- Ensure this works on resize.

2) “Newest” sort dropdown arrow positioning
- The down-arrow/chevron for the sort dropdown is rendering inside/overlapping the text.
- Fix the dropdown styling so the arrow sits in the correct position (like the template select inputs) and does not overlap the label/value.

3) Incoming chat bubbles too narrow
- Customer/inbound bubbles are too narrow (one word per line).
- Increase bubble max-width to match the template behaviour (e.g. ~65–75% of the chat pane width for inbound/outbound, responsive).
- Ensure long messages wrap naturally and don’t create skinny columns.

4) Contact actions: add to lists / tags
- From the Contact details panel (or appropriate UI in this screen), the user must be able to:
  - Add an existing contact to one or more Lists
  - Add/manage Tags for the contact
- Reuse existing List/Tag components and workflows from Contact Book (do not create new patterns).
- If backend wiring isn’t complete, add TODO but keep UI consistent.

5) Avatar initials styling
- The initials/avatar circles in the conversation list and chat header should have a purple circular border/ring (match the Messages template accent).
- Do not change the avatar size; just apply the correct ring/border styling.

6) Date + time in chat thread
- Display date/time within the conversation thread:
  - Each message shows a timestamp (time)
  - Also show date separators when the day changes (e.g. “15 Jan 2025”)
- Format must match the Messages template (subtle, secondary text).

Constraints:
- Do NOT change overall layout structure beyond making the composer fixed and correcting the collapse behaviour.
- Do NOT introduce new colours/components; reuse existing template classes/components.
- Keep changes limited to Messages/Inbox module files.

Acceptance checklist:
- Basic RCS shows RCS Agent + SMS SenderID fallback selection.
- Composer is fixed at bottom; no page scrolling required to send.
- Right panel collapse works (no teleporting to bottom-left).
- Sort dropdown chevron is positioned correctly.
- Inbound bubbles use sensible width.
- Can add existing contact to lists and tags using existing components.
- Avatars have purple ring styling.
- Date separators + message times appear in thread.
