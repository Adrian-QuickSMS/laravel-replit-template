MINI PROMPT — Admin Console: Email-to-SMS (Overview only) = exact copy of Customer Overview (global view)

Context
Build Admin Console → Email-to-SMS with ONLY the “Overview” tab/page.
This must be an IDENTICAL copy of the Customer Portal → Management → Email-to-SMS → Overview:
- Same layout, table styling, filters/search, row actions, modals, status pills, pagination, empty states
- Same underlying logic and behaviours
- No new UI patterns or features

Only Differences (Hard Rules)
1) Global Scope:
- Admin view shows Email-to-SMS configs across ALL customer accounts (not one account).
- Add a FIRST column in the table: “Account” (customer account name).
- Add Account filter (dropdown/searchable) using the same filter component style (Apply Filters pattern).

2) Admin Styling:
- Replace Fillow purple accents with Admin blue accents ONLY where the theme colour is used.
- Do NOT change row status colours, warning colours, table row highlights, or any non-theme status colour mapping.

Constraints
- DO NOT redesign anything.
- Reuse the existing Customer Overview components and logic. Do not duplicate code.
- Implement as shared component(s): e.g., EmailToSmsOverviewTable shared between Customer + Admin.
- Admin version is the same component with props/flags:
  - scope="GLOBAL"
  - theme="ADMIN_BLUE"
  - showAccountColumn=true

Data / Integration (Mock for now)
- Use a shared mock service/store for Email-to-SMS configs (same unified model as customer):
  EmailToSmsConfig { id, type (STANDARD|CONTACT_LIST), name, status, createdAt, updatedAt, accountId, accountName, ... }
- Admin Overview reads from the same store/service but returns results across all accounts.
- All actions must update the same store so UI updates instantly.

Row Actions (Must be identical)
- Keep the same three-dot menu actions and behaviour as customer overview:
  View / Edit / Suspend / Reactivate / Archive (whatever exists today)
- Action outcomes and confirmations must be the same modals/toasts.
- Edit/View must route to the correct type flow (STANDARD vs CONTACT_LIST) using existing admin routes (no UI changes).

Filtering / Searching
- Search bar left, filter/apply controls consistent with existing Overview.
- Filters do not auto-apply; require Apply Filters button (same as customer).
- Add Account filter only (plus any existing filters already on Overview).

Acceptance Criteria
- Admin Email-to-SMS Overview visually matches customer Overview 1:1 (except theme colour + Account column).
- Table includes Account as first column and supports sorting like other columns.
- Filters/search behave identically; Account filter works.
- All row actions work and update status pills immediately.
- No duplicated UI logic; shared component is reused with minimal admin-specific wrapper.
