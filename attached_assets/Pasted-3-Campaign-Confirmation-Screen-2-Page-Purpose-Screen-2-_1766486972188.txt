3. Campaign Confirmation (Screen 2)
Page Purpose
Screen 2 provides a final, read-only confirmation of the campaign configuration before submission.
It validates all inputs from Screen 1, presents a clear delivery summary, and—where possible—displays transparent pricing.
This screen is the last point of user confirmation before messages are queued or scheduled.

3.5 Pricing Summary ⭐ (New Section)
Purpose
Provides transparent cost information where determinable, without misrepresenting RCS pricing.
________________________________________
3.5.1 Pricing Rules (Authoritative)
SMS Pricing
•	SMS unit price is retrieved from pricing database
•	Total SMS cost can be calculated upfront
RCS Pricing
•	RCS delivery depends on handset/network support
•	Exact RCS penetration cannot be known in advance
•	Therefore:
o	No total campaign price is shown, only the price of a RCS Basic and RCS Single message
o	Only explanatory messaging is displayed
________________________________________
3.5.2 Pricing Display Logic
A. SMS Only Campaigns
Displayed fields:
•	Price per SMS
•	Estimated SMS count
•	Subtotal (ex VAT)
•	VAT (20%) (if applicable)
•	Total price
________________________________________
VAT Handling
•	Account-level flag: vat_applicable = true | false
•	If true:
o	VAT calculated at 20%
o	VAT line item shown
•	If false:
o	VAT line omitted
o	Helper text shown:
“VAT not applicable for this account.”
________________________________________
Example Display
Messages:          10,000
Price per SMS:     £0.023
Subtotal:          £230.00
VAT (20%):         £46.00
Total:             £276.00
________________________________________
B. Basic RCS or Rich RCS Campaigns
Displayed Messaging
Instead of a price breakdown, show:
Pricing notice
“This campaign includes RCS delivery. Because RCS availability varies by handset and network, the final cost cannot be calculated in advance.
SMS fallback messages will be charged at your agreed SMS rate. RCS messages are billed based on actual delivery.”
________________________________________
Optional (If You Want Later)
•	Show:
o	SMS fallback unit price
o	“Final charges will be available in reporting”
(But no totals)
________________________________________
3.5.3 Pricing Persistence & Audit
The system must store:
•	Pricing model used (SMS-only / RCS)
•	SMS unit price at time of send
•	VAT applied or not
•	User who confirmed pricing screen
•	Timestamp
Used for:
•	Billing
•	Invoicing
•	Dispute resolution
•	Audit trails
________________________________________
