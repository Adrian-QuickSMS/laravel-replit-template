Fix the Inbox / Messages menu icon behaviour and unread notification indicators.

A) Inbox/Messages icon click behaviour
- The Inbox/Messages icon in the main navigation (the one circled in red) must navigate to the Inbox module/screen when clicked.
- It should not open notifications or any other screen.
- Use the same route as the current Inbox module entry point.

B) Notification counter in navigation
- The red notification badge on the Inbox/Messages icon must show the TOTAL number of unread inbox conversations.
- This value should match the unread count shown in the Inbox conversation list.
- If the count is currently coming from another state or variable, correct it so it uses the unread inbox count.

C) Notification badge colour consistency
- The red badge in the navigation and the unread notification badge inside the chat list must use the SAME red colour token/class.
- Use the same red styling as the main navigation notification badge:
  - Background colour
  - Text colour
  - Border radius
  - Padding
- Do NOT introduce a new red; only reuse the existing notification colour that is already used in the navbar badge.

D) Unread indicator in chat list
- The unread notification dot/badge in the chat list (next to each conversation) must match:
  - The same red colour
  - The same style rules (badge shape/pill/dot)
- When a conversation is marked as read or unread, this badge should update immediately and the navigation badge count should also change.

E) Constraints
- Do NOT modify routes for any other navigation items.
- Do NOT create a new design system; use existing colour and badge styles.
- Only adjust the Inbox icon click handler, unread count state, and badge styling.

Acceptance checklist:
- Clicking the Inbox/Messages icon correctly loads the Inbox module.
- The badge number in the nav matches the unread count in the inbox list.
- All unread badges use the SAME red colour and consistent style.
- Mark as read / mark as unread updates the nav badge count immediately.
