Fix the layout and footer issues on the Inbox / Messages screen. Use the existing app layout and Messages template. Do NOT redesign.

A) Remove footer copyright / “designed by” text
- Remove the copyright / “designed by” text that appears at the very bottom of the page.
- This text should not be shown anywhere on the Inbox / Messages screen.
- Do not add any replacement footer there.

B) Restore Contact Details panel to right-hand side
Current problem:
- The Contact Details panel has moved to the bottom-left of the page and is causing extra scroll.

Required behaviour:
- The Contact Details panel must be a RIGHT-HAND SIDEBAR, not a bottom block.
- It should sit to the right of the chat thread, as a vertical column, consistent with previous design.
- It must not push content down or create extra vertical scroll.

Implementation notes:
- Ensure the layout is a 3-column structure:
  - Left: Inbox list
  - Centre: Chat thread + composer
  - Right: Contact Details sidebar
- Remove any positioning or layout changes that placed the Contact Details block at the bottom (e.g. flex-wrap, wrong grid area, or stacking on small screens where not intended).
- The Contact Details panel should scroll internally if content is long, not force the whole page to scroll.

C) Fix the Channel / Send Message composer so it is always visible at the bottom
Current problem:
- The channel + send message composer section now requires scrolling to reach; it is not always visible.

Required behaviour:
- The composer (channel selector + SenderID/RCS agent + content editor + send button) must be “anchored” to the bottom of the central chat area and always visible without page scroll.
- User should never have to scroll the main page to access the send controls.

Implementation notes:
- Inside the central column (chat area), structure it as:
  - Chat header
  - Scrollable messages container (overflow-y: auto)
  - Fixed/sticky composer at the bottom of this column.

- Add sufficient bottom padding to the messages container so the last message is not hidden behind the composer.
- Do NOT move the composer outside the central column.
- Do NOT add any global page scroll hacks that break the app’s base layout.

Constraints:
- Reuse the existing layout/container structure used by the Messages template in other screens (e.g., Send Message page).
- Do NOT change global layout, headers, or other pages.
- Limit changes to the Inbox/Messages layout, Contact Details positioning, and composer positioning.

Acceptance checklist:
- No footer “designed by” text appears at the bottom of the page.
- Contact Details panel appears on the RIGHT side as a sidebar (not bottom-left) and does not create extra page scroll.
- Channel/Send Message composer is fixed/anchored at the bottom of the chat column and is always visible without scrolling the main page.
- Only the Inbox list and chat messages scroll in their own areas; the composer stays visible.
