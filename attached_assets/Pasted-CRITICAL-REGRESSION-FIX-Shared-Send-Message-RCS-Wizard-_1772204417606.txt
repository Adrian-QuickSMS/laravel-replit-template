CRITICAL REGRESSION FIX — Shared Send Message / RCS Wizard wiring

We have multiple regressions across modules after pulling “RCS creation wizard backend” back into UI.
This is NOT a set of isolated bugs — it’s a shared module integration regression.

GOAL
Restore the Customer Portal > Messages > Send Message flow to its previously working behaviour by:
- removing mock data fallbacks,
- re-wiring shared wizard components to real APIs,
- ensuring all dependent integrations (numbers, contact book lists, RCS agent assets) use the same shared source.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
- Do NOT redesign.
- Do NOT create new wizard implementations.
- The shared wizard must be the single source used by Send Message, Template Create/Edit, Inbox.
- Use Fillow components (customer portal = purple; admin portal = blue).
- No module may replace real API data with mock arrays.

STEP 1 — Identify the root cause
1) Locate the last commit where Send Message worked fully:
   - Opt-out management shows BOTH VMNs and Shortcodes correctly
   - Opt-out screening lists are real contact-book lists (not mock)
   - RCS agent logo renders correctly (circle crop / correct aspect, not oval)
2) Produce a diff list of files changed since that commit for:
   - shared wizard components
   - service/api adapters
   - preview renderer (RCS logo + hero)
   - opt-out management
3) Search repository for mock sources used by these screens:
   keywords: mock, fixture, demoData, sampleData, USE_MOCK, isMock, fallbackData
   Remove/disable mock fallbacks from production flows.

STEP 2 — Fix Numbers availability regression (VMN present, Shortcode missing)
- Find the “numbers available for opt-out” data source.
- Ensure the UI merges ALL valid number types:
  - VMN/Longcode
  - Dedicated Shortcode
  - Shared Shortcode keywords (where relevant)
- Confirm backend endpoint returns all types OR call the correct endpoints and merge results.
- Add a clear error if shortcodes endpoint fails (do not fallback to mock).

STEP 3 — Fix Opt-out screening list regression (mock lists + screening not working)
- Remove mock list injection.
- Reconnect screening list dropdown to real Contact Book lists:
  - must pull from the same source used elsewhere (Contact Book module)
- Ensure selection writes the correct list IDs into message send payload.
- Confirm screening is enforced at send time (block recipients who are opted out).

STEP 4 — Fix RCS Agent logo rendering regression (oval logo)
- Ensure Send Message uses the shared preview component (same as before).
- Find where CSS changed:
  - restore correct container sizing and object-fit behaviour
  - restore correct circle crop preview logic (or whatever the prior “fixed” behaviour was)
- Ensure this fix applies everywhere the shared preview is used.

STEP 5 — Prevent future regressions
- Add a lightweight integration check:
  - Numbers API returns both VMN and Shortcode types
  - Contact lists API returns real lists
  - RCS agent assets render with correct aspect/crop
- If API fails, show Fillow error banner, not mock data.

OUTPUT REQUIRED
- List of files changed
- Summary of root cause (1-2 paragraphs)
- Exact fixes applied per issue
- Confirmation that Send Message, Template wizard, Inbox now all use the same shared wizard + preview.
