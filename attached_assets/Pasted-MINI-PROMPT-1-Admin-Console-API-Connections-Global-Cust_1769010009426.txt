MINI PROMPT 1 — Admin Console: API Connections (Global) = Customer “Management → API Connections” (Identical, Admin Blue)

Goal
Create an Admin Console module “API Connections” that is an IDENTICAL copy of the customer portal module:
Management → API Connections
Same functionality, same UI layout, same filters, same table, same three-dot actions, same modals, same validation, same error/empty states.
DO NOT redesign anything and DO NOT create a second implementation.

Critical Constraints
- Reuse the existing customer API Connections components/logic. Do NOT duplicate code.
- ONLY theme change: swap Fillow purple accents to Admin Blue accents (admin console theme).
- Keep all semantic colours unchanged (status pills, warnings, row colouring, etc.). Only accent theme shifts to blue.
- Keep the same filter behaviour as customer (Apply Filters / no auto-filter if that’s how it works there).

Admin-Only Differences (Only These Changes)
1) Global scope (all customer accounts)
- Data/query returns API connections across ALL customer accounts (admin scope).
- Default = “All accounts”.

2) Table: add Account as first column
- Add a new first column: “Account” (customer account name).
- All other columns remain identical to customer module and keep the same order AFTER Account.
- Account column must be sortable and included in search matching if search exists.

3) Create API Connection wizard: add Account selector
- Wizard must reuse the existing customer Create API Connection wizard (same step flow, same cards, same validation).
- Add “Account” dropdown at the top of the wizard (earliest step, before Sub-Account).
  - Searchable dropdown, single-select, required.
- Sub-Account dropdown remains required and is filtered by selected Account.
- Everything else unchanged.

Backend-Ready / Mocking
- If admin endpoints don’t exist yet, mock them but keep payloads aligned with the customer API Connections model + Account field.
- Row actions must still work with mock services:
  - Suspend / Reactivate
  - Convert Test → Live
  - Regenerate API Key (must display the NEW key once in the final confirm step)

Acceptance Criteria
- Looks/behaves exactly like customer API Connections (only Admin Blue accent).
- Account is first column and sortable.
- Wizard includes Account selector; Sub-Account filtered by Account.
- No new UI patterns or duplicate module implementations.
