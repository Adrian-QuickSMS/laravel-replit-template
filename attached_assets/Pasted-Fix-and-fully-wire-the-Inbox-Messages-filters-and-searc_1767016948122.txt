Fix and fully wire the Inbox / Messages filters and search, using mock data so I can verify behaviour before we connect a real database.

────────────────────────
A) Create/extend realistic mock data for testing

First, create a clear mock dataset for the Inbox conversation list and use it as the data source for filters and search.

Mock data requirements (per conversation):
- contactName (optional for some rows, to test number-only)
- mobileNumber
- channel (SMS or RCS)
- unreadCount (0 or >0)
- lastMessageIsSMS (boolean or derived from channel)
- lastMessageIsRCS (boolean or derived from channel)
- sourceType: "VMN" | "ShortCode" | "RCSAgent"
- sourceLabel: e.g. "07123 456789", "60777", "Acme Banking Bot"
- combinedSourceDisplay: e.g. "07123 456789 (VMN)", "60777 (Short Code)", "Acme Banking Bot (RCS Agent)"

Use at least 25–30 conversations with a mix of:
- Some SMS, some RCS.
- Some unread, some fully read.
- Mix of VMNs, Short Codes, RCS Agents.
- Some with only numbers (no contact name), some with names.

Make sure these values are also what you display:
- In the chat list pills/indicators (SMS/RCS, unread).
- Under the contact name in the central chat window: the same “source” label (e.g. "60777 (Short Code)").

────────────────────────
B) Status filter: All / Unread / SMS / RCS

Fix the Status filter so it actually filters the mock data.

Filter options:
- All
- Unread
- SMS
- RCS

Expected behaviour:
- All:
  - Show all conversations (no status restriction).
- Unread:
  - Show only conversations where unreadCount > 0.
- SMS:
  - Show only conversations where channel = "SMS" (or last message is SMS, depending on your model).
- RCS:
  - Show only conversations where channel = "RCS" (or last message is RCS).

Notes:
- The filter should match what is visually implied by the pills/notification icons in the chat list.
- Only ONE of these (All / Unread / SMS / RCS) should be active at a time.

────────────────────────
C) Source filter: All Sources / Specific ShortCodes / Specific VMNs / Specific RCS Agents

Fix the Source filter so it uses the same data you show under the contact name in the central chat header.

Filter options:
- All Sources
- Specific ShortCodes
- Specific VMNs
- Specific RCS Agents

Expected behaviour:
- All Sources:
  - Do not restrict by sourceType (show all).
- Specific ShortCodes:
  - Show only conversations where sourceType = "ShortCode".
- Specific VMNs:
  - Show only conversations where sourceType = "VMN".
- Specific RCS Agents:
  - Show only conversations where sourceType = "RCSAgent".

Dropdown / selection:
- The dropdown for selecting a specific source must list:
  - The actual sourceLabel values on the account, in this format:
    - "07123 456789 (VMN)"
    - "60777 (Short Code)"
    - "Acme Banking Bot (RCS Agent)"

The same label must:
- Appear under the contact name in the central chat window.
- Be used as the filter value for Source filtering.

Combination:
- Status filter and Source filter must work together (AND logic):
  - e.g. Unread + Specific VMNs → only unread VMN conversations.

────────────────────────
D) Search bar in chat list

The search bar above the chat list must be functional and search against the mock data.

Search behaviour:
- Filter the conversation list by:
  - contactName
  - OR mobileNumber
- Case-insensitive matching is fine.
- Typing should update the list as you type OR when pressing Enter (choose one, but make it consistent).
- Clearing the search restores the full filtered set (respecting the active Status + Source filters).

Important:
- Search must apply on top of the active filters:
  - Example: Unread + VMNs + search “John” → only unread VMN conversations where name or number matches “John”.

────────────────────────
E) Constraints

- Do NOT redesign the UI.
- Do NOT change pill/label visuals here; only fix wiring and logic.
- Keep everything backed by the mock dataset so behaviour is visible and testable now.
- Add clear TODO comments wherever this will later be replaced by real database queries / API calls.

────────────────────────
F) Acceptance checklist

- I can switch between All / Unread / SMS / RCS and see the list visibly change based on mock data.
- I can switch between All Sources / Specific ShortCodes / Specific VMNs / Specific RCS Agents and see the list change.
- The source shown under the contact name in the central chat header matches the source filter values.
- I can type a name or mobile number in the search bar and see only matching conversations.
- Filters and search work together (Status + Source + Search) and produce sensible results.
