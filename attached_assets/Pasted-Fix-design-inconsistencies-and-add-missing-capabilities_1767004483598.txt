Fix design inconsistencies and add missing capabilities in the Inbox / Messages module.

IMPORTANT:
- Reuse existing UI components and styles from:
  - Contact Book (avatars, tags, lists)
  - Messages / Send Message (bubbles, pills, inputs)
- Do NOT invent new styles or components.
- Goal is consistency across the whole platform.

────────────────────────
A) Avatar consistency with Contact Book

Use the SAME avatar design principles everywhere:

1) Conversation list (left column)
- Current: two grey letters with no coloured circle.
- Required:
  - Purple circular background (same purple as in Contact Book).
  - White, bold initials text.
  - Center the initials vertically and horizontally.

2) Chat thread (message bubbles area)
- Same avatar style as above when avatars are shown near messages.

3) Contact details (right sidebar)
- Current: square avatar, badly centred initials.
- Required:
  - Circular avatar, same size and style as Contact Book.
  - Purple fill, white centered initials.
- Reuse the same avatar component used in Contact Book so it’s consistent across the platform.

────────────────────────
B) SMS / RCS pill colours + message bubble colours

Standardise SMS/RCS colours across the platform:

1) Channel pills/tags
- SMS pill: Green, using “Apple SMS green” (or the closest existing green token).
- RCS pill: Blue, using “iMessage blue” (or the closest existing blue token).
- Apply this styling:
  - In the left Inbox conversation list.
  - Anywhere else SMS/RCS pills are displayed.

2) Message bubble colours
- Instead of purple text boxes:
  - SMS messages should use the SMS green colour.
  - RCS messages should use the RCS blue colour.
- Keep text readable and accessible (white or dark text as appropriate).
- Keep alignment and bubble shapes consistent with the Messages template.

────────────────────────
C) Inbox filter by inbound channel (VMN / Short Code / RCS Agent)

Add filter capability to the Inbox list:

- New filter to allow filtering conversations by:
  - VMN (Virtual Mobile Number)
  - Short code
  - RCS Agent
- Use existing filter UI pattern (dropdowns / chips) from the app.
- Filter should apply to the conversation list and update the results in real time.

────────────────────────
D) Conversation header: show where the message was sent from

At the top of the message thread (header where contact name + avatar + masked mobile number appear):

- Also display where the conversation is being handled:
  - For SMS: the VMN or short code (e.g. “From: 60777”).
  - For RCS: the RCS Agent name (and logo if available).
- This should be clearly visible but styled consistently with existing header metadata.

────────────────────────
E) Tag and List colour consistency in Contact Details

In the contact details section on the right:

- Tags:
  - Use the exact same colours as defined when tags are created in the Contact Book.
- Lists:
  - Display lists with the same pinky-purple style used in the Contact Book lists UI.
- Do NOT introduce new tag/list colours; reuse what exists in Contact Book.

────────────────────────
F) Notes in contact details (with audit info)

Add a Notes capability in the contact details section:

- UI:
  - A text area/input to add a new note.
  - A button to save the note.

- On save:
  - The note is stored with:
    - Timestamp (date + time)
    - User ID / user name who added the note
  - Notes are displayed in a list with newest first.

- Display format:
  - Show note text.
  - Show “Added by [User Name] on [Date Time]”.

────────────────────────
G) Tag and List management actions in contact details

In the contact details section on Inbox:

1) Buttons:
- “Add to List” button
- “Add Tag” button

Behaviour:
- Reuse the same components/flows as in Contact Book:
  - Add to existing list(s).
  - Add existing tags or create new ones if allowed.

2) View Contact button:
- Add a “View Contact” button.
- Clicking it opens a pop-up/modal showing the detailed contact information used in the Contact Book (same fields, layout reused where possible).
- This is for viewing/editing contact details without leaving the Inbox.

────────────────────────
Constraints

- Use existing components/partials for:
  - Avatars
  - Tags and lists
  - Pills/badges
  - Modals
  - Filters
- Do NOT redesign the overall layout.
- Do NOT introduce new global colours or fonts.
- Limit changes to the Messages/Inbox and shared contact components.

────────────────────────
Acceptance checklist

- Avatars in Inbox + chat thread + contact details match Contact Book (purple circles, white initials, centred).
- SMS and RCS indicators are green and blue pills everywhere they appear.
- Chat bubbles use green (SMS) and blue (RCS) backgrounds instead of purple, aligned with template style.
- Inbox has a working filter for VMN / Short code / RCS Agent.
- Conversation header indicates the number/agent the messages are sent from.
- Tags and lists in contact details use the same colours as Contact Book.
- Notes can be added in contact details with timestamp and user attribution.
- Contact details supports “Add to List”, “Add Tag”, and “View Contact” (modal) using existing patterns.
