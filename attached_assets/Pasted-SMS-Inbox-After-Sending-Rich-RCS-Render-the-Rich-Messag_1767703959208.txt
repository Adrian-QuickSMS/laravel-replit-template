SMS Inbox — After Sending Rich RCS, Render the Rich Message in the Chat Thread

Requirement:
- In the SMS Inbox, when a user creates a Rich RCS message in the wizard and presses “Send Message”, the sent Rich RCS content must immediately appear in the central chat thread as an outbound message.

Behaviour:
1) Send action
- On “Send Message”:
  - Call the existing Send RCS API using the wizard’s final saved Rich RCS payload (cards/carousel/buttons/media URLs).
  - Use the selected RCS agent and required SMS fallback SenderID (if applicable).

2) Chat thread rendering (IMPORTANT)
- After successful send, append a new outbound message item to the current conversation thread UI.
- The message bubble should render the Rich RCS preview, not plain text.
  - If Rich Card: show the card with image + title/description/body + up to buttons.
  - If Carousel: show the carousel UI (first card + navigation indicator or thumbnails).
- Outbound bubble styling must follow existing rules:
  - RCS outbound uses the RCS bubble styling (blue / RCS pill if used elsewhere).
- Include:
  - timestamp
  - channel indicator (RCS)
  - delivery status placeholder (Sent → Delivered/Read when updates arrive, if supported)

3) State updates
- Close the wizard modal on success and return focus to the chat thread.
- Clear the composer state for the next message (do not retain previous rich payload).
- Ensure the left conversation list updates its snippet/time to reflect the newly sent message.

4) Failure handling
- If send fails:
  - Do NOT add the message to the thread.
  - Show an inline error (and keep wizard open) explaining the failure.

Constraints:
- Do not invent a new rich message renderer.
- Reuse the same rich rendering component used in the wizard/Send Message preview, but adapted for the chat bubble container.
- Do not require a full page refresh; update UI state locally on success.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Sending a Rich RCS message results in the rich card/carousel appearing in the chat thread immediately as an outbound message.
- The bubble rendering matches the wizard preview content (image/buttons/text).
- Composer resets after successful send.
- If send fails, user sees an error and nothing is appended to the thread.
