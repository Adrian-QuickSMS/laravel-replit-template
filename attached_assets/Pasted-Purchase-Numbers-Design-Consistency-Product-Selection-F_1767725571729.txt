Purchase → Numbers — Design Consistency + Product/Selection Flows (Match Purchase → Messages)

Goal:
Make Purchase → Numbers visually consistent with Purchase → Messages (same card/tile design, badge styling, spacing, typography, and CTA patterns). Reuse existing template components. Do NOT invent new UI designs.

────────────────────────
A) Replace the 3 tiles and align naming to UK purchase products
────────────────────────
Current issue:
- Tiles currently show: “UK long code”, “international VMN”, “Toll Free Number” (not aligned to spec or UK-first design).

Requirement:
- Replace the three tiles with these exact products/labels:
  1) UK Virtual Mobile Number
  2) UK Shared Short Code
  3) UK Dedicated Short Code

Design:
- Tiles/cards must use the same design system as Purchase → Messages cards:
  - Same background, padding, rounded corners, typography
  - Same badge styling (white rounded badges)
  - Same primary CTA button style

Acceptance Criteria:
- The 3 tiles look and feel identical to Purchase → Messages cards (only content differs).
- Labels match exactly as above.

────────────────────────
B) Pricing badges: Setup Cost + Monthly Cost
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Each tile shows 2 pricing badges:
  - “Setup Cost”
  - “Monthly Cost”
- Badge style must match Purchase → Messages (white badge, rounded corners, consistent font weights).

Dedicated Short Code pricing rule:
- For UK Dedicated Short Code:
  - Setup Cost badge value: “Contact sales (price on request)”
  - Monthly Cost badge value: “Contact sales (price on request)”
  - No numeric price shown.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Badges appear consistently on all three tiles.
- Dedicated Short Code shows “Contact sales (price on request)” for both badges.

────────────────────────
C) Tile selection behaviour: show the correct table per chosen product
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Selecting a tile switches the lower section to the appropriate table UI:

1) UK Virtual Mobile Number
- Show a table of AVAILABLE VMNs only.
- Do NOT show bought/owned numbers.
- Do NOT show reserved/unavailable VMNs.

2) UK Shared Short Code
- Show a table/list of available shared short codes.
- Also include keyword purchase UI (see section D).

3) UK Dedicated Short Code
- Do NOT show inventory table.
- Show “Contact sales” guidance and a CTA (e.g., “Contact Sales”) only.

Constraints:
- Only one product selection active at a time.
- Keep page layout stable; only the lower content swaps.

Acceptance Criteria:
- VMN selection shows only available VMNs.
- Shared shortcode selection shows available shortcode(s) + keyword UI.
- Dedicated shortcode shows contact sales only.

────────────────────────
D) UK Shared Short Code: keyword input + taken keywords list
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Under UK Shared Short Code:
  - Input box: “Enter keyword”
  - User can add multiple keywords (multi-add).
  - Below: a “Taken keywords” list/table that is:
    - searchable
    - filterable
  - Taken keywords are read-only (cannot be selected).

Validation (lightweight UI enforcement):
- Alphanumeric only, no spaces, case-insensitive uniqueness.
- Show inline errors under the input if invalid.

Acceptance Criteria:
- User can add multiple keywords to a “selected keywords” list before purchase.
- Taken keywords list supports search and filters.

────────────────────────
E) Multi-select purchase flows + primary CTA placement
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- For VMN and Shared Short Code flows, support selecting/adding multiple items before purchase:
  - VMN: multi-select numbers from table
  - Shared shortcode: multiple keywords via input + list

CTA placement:
- The primary “Purchase” button must be positioned at the TOP RIGHT of the active table area:
  - VMN: top right of VMN table
  - Shared shortcode: top right of shortcode/keyword table section
- This must be the primary CTA styling (same as Purchase → Messages).

On click “Purchase”:
- Show a confirmation modal that includes:
  - Count of items selected (numbers or keywords)
  - Setup Cost total
  - Monthly Cost total
  - Assignment:
    - Option A: Assign to sub-account now (dropdown)
    - Option B: Choose later (allowed)
  - Confirm Purchase button

Constraints:
- Reuse existing modal + CTA patterns from Purchase → Messages where possible.
- Do NOT force assignment immediately; user may choose later.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can select multiple VMNs or enter multiple keywords.
- Purchase CTA is top-right of the relevant table section and visually primary.
- Confirmation modal allows “assign now” or “choose later” and then confirms purchase.
