SMS Inbox — Rich RCS Sending + Chat Thread Rendering Fixes

We need to correct two issues:
1) Rich card message body/content is not visible in the chat thread renderer.
2) Message is being sent when clicking “Apply RCS Content” — it must only send when clicking “Send message” in the Inbox composer.

────────────────────────
A) Fix: Rich RCS message content must render in chat thread
────────────────────────
Current issue:
- In the chat thread, the Rich RCS bubble shows the card container/media/buttons but the actual message content (text body) is missing.

Requirement:
- Update the Rich RCS chat renderer so it displays ALL rich card fields:
  - Media (if present)
  - Description/title (if used in your model)
  - Message text body (the main content field) — MUST be visible
  - Buttons (up to supported limit)
- For Carousel:
  - Render first card + indicator, but ensure each card’s text body is visible when that card is shown.

Constraints:
- Do not invent a new layout.
- Reuse the same Rich RCS preview renderer used in the wizard where possible, but ensure it includes the text/body region.
- Maintain existing bubble styling and padding rules.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Rich RCS messages in the chat thread clearly show the message text body as part of the card.
- The rendered content matches the wizard preview fields (no missing sections).

B) Fix: “Apply RCS Content” must NOT send — Send only via Inbox “Send message”
────────────────────────
Current issue:
- Clicking “Apply RCS Content” is triggering the send action.

Required behaviour:
1) Apply-only behaviour
- “Apply RCS Content” must only:
  - Save/commit the RCS payload into the Inbox composer state (draft state)
  - Update the phone preview in the composer (if applicable)
  - Close the wizard and return user to the Inbox
- It must NOT call any send API.

2) Send behaviour
- The message must be sent ONLY when the user clicks:
  - “Send message” in the Inbox content creator/composer box.
- On “Send message”:
  - If channel = Rich RCS:
    - send using the last applied Rich RCS payload from composer state
    - then append the outbound rich message to the chat thread (with full content visible)
  - If channel = SMS/Basic RCS:
    - send as normal

Constraints:
- Do not allow any API send calls from “Apply RCS Content”.
- Keep button naming/UX the same unless absolutely necessary.
- Ensure composer state is cleared only after successful “Send message”, not after Apply.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Clicking “Apply RCS Content” never sends a message.
- Clicking “Send message” sends the applied Rich RCS message and appends it to the chat thread.
- If the user applies content then edits again, it updates the draft payload without sending.
