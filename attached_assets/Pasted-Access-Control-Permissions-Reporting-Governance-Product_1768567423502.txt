Access Control, Permissions & Reporting Governance
Product Requirements Specification
________________________________________
1. Purpose
This section defines how users, roles, sender capabilities, permissions, and reporting access are managed within the QuickSMS platform.
It ensures:
•	Secure delegation of messaging capabilities
•	Prevention of unauthorised spend or compliance breaches
•	Clear separation of duties (operations, finance, technical, audit)
•	Granular access aligned with enterprise and NHS requirements
•	Full auditability of all permission-sensitive actions
This model applies consistently across:
•	Send Message / Campaigns
•	Inbox
•	Templates
•	Reporting
•	Message Logs
•	API Connections
•	Email-to-SMS
________________________________________
2. Access Control Model Overview
QuickSMS uses a four-layer access control model:
1.	Account Scope – Main Account vs Sub-Account boundary
2.	Role – Defines where a user can go
3.	Sender Capability Level – Defines how messages can be composed and sent
4.	Permission Toggles – Fine-grained feature controls
Permissions are evaluated in the following order:
Account Scope → Role → Sender Capability Level → Permission Toggles
This avoids role explosion while allowing precise, auditable control.
