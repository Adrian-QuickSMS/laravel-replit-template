Fix the remaining issues with the composer on the Inbox / Messages screen. Use existing components and behaviour from the Send Message screen and Contact Book. Do NOT redesign.

────────────────────────
A) Placeholder (“Insert field”) – must be connected to Contact Book

Problem:
- The placeholder selector in the text field does not work and is not connected to contact data.

Requirements:
- Wire the placeholder/merge-field selector to the Contact Book:
  - It must load available fields from Contact Book:
    - Standard fields (e.g. firstName, lastName, postcode, etc.)
    - Custom contact fields (if supported).
- Selecting a placeholder inserts it at the current cursor position in the message text area.
- Placeholders must use the same format as Send Message (e.g. {{firstName}}).

Implementation note:
- Reuse the same placeholder/insert-field component and logic used on the Send Message screen.
- If a reusable service/helper exists, call it instead of duplicating logic.

────────────────────────
B) AI button – must match Send Message behaviour

Problem:
- The AI button in the Inbox composer currently does nothing or behaves differently from the Send Message AI button.

Requirements:
- Make the Inbox AI button use the SAME behaviour as the Send Message AI button:
  - Same pop-up/modal UI.
  - Same options (e.g., improve message, rewrite, change tone, etc., as implemented in Send Message).
  - Same flow for applying AI-suggested content back into the editor.

Implementation note:
- Reuse the same AI modal component and handler functions from Send Message.
- Do not create a new AI workflow just for Inbox.

────────────────────────
C) Emoji picker – full pop-up with search and “recently used”

Problem:
- The emoji picker is basic / non-functional and does not meet requirements.

Requirements:
- Emoji picker opens as a pop-up/modal aligned to the emoji icon near the editor.
- Features:
  - Search bar at the top to search emojis by name/keyword.
  - Scrollable emoji library organised into categories (if available).
  - “Recently used” section showing the last used emojis.
- Inserting an emoji:
  - Inserts at the cursor position in the message text area.
  - Updates the “recently used” list.

Implementation note:
- If there is an existing emoji component elsewhere, reuse or extend it.
- Keep styling consistent with the app (no third-party visual style clashes).

────────────────────────
D) SMS and RCS pills – must use rounded Tag/List pill styling

Problem:
- SMS and RCS pills are still square; they don’t match existing pill styling.
- Screenshots show SMS/RCS pills circled in red and correct Tag/List pills circled in blue.

Requirements:
- Apply the same pill styling used for Tags/Lists to ALL SMS/RCS pills:
  - Fully rounded pill shape (large border radius).
  - Same padding and typography as Tag/List pills.
- The only differences should be colour:
  - SMS pill = green (as already defined).
  - RCS pill = blue (as already defined).

Locations:
- Conversation list (left column).
- Chat thread header.
- Anywhere else SMS/RCS pills appear in Inbox/Messages.

Implementation note:
- Find the Tag/List pill component or CSS class used in Contact Book and reuse that exact component/class.
- Do not hand-code new rectangles for SMS/RCS.

────────────────────────
Constraints:
- Reuse existing components and logic from:
  - Send Message (AI button, placeholder/merge fields, emoji behaviour if present).
  - Contact Book (placeholder fields, tag/list pill styles).
- Do NOT introduce new visual styles or redesign the composer.
- Limit changes strictly to the Inbox/Messages composer and shared components.

Acceptance checklist:
- Placeholder selector shows Contact Book fields and inserts tokens like {{firstName}} at the cursor.
- AI button opens the same modal and behaviour as Send Message and can apply AI-generated content.
- Emoji picker is a pop-up with search, scrollable library, and a “recently used” section, inserting emojis at cursor.
- All SMS/RCS pills in Inbox/Messages use the same pill shape as Tag/List pills, just with green/blue colours.
