Replit Mini Prompt — Templates Create (Stage 2) MUST reuse shared Send Message composer (no UI drift)

Context
We are refactoring Customer Portal → Management → Templates → Create/Edit. The content step must use the exact same shared composer as Messages → Send Message (shared source of truth), including all controls, layout, toggles, dropdowns, and logic.

Bug / Regression
When selecting Basic RCS or Rich RCS inside Template Create/Edit:

The RCS Agent dropdown has disappeared

The “Improve with API” button is in a different place than Send Message

Trackable link and Message expiry toggles are missing

Opt-out management card/setting is missing or moved

Some social/other toggles present in Send Message are not present
This proves Template Create is NOT using the shared Send Message source or has forked UI/logic.

Hard Requirements (non-negotiable)

Do not rebuild, redesign, or fork the content composer UI for templates.

The Templates “Content” step must mount the same shared component used by Send Message (single shared code path), passing only a mode="template" (or equivalent) flag to hide recipients/pricing/scheduling — but everything else must remain identical.

All controls that exist in Send Message must also exist here in the same places, including:

Channel toggle (SMS / Basic RCS / Rich RCS)

SenderID dropdown

RCS Agent dropdown (must show for Basic/Rich RCS modes exactly as in Send Message)

“Improve with API” button in the same location

Trackable link toggle + expiry toggle (same card/placement)

Opt-out management card in its traditional place (same placement as Send Message)

Any other toggles/cards present in Send Message must render unchanged

Rich RCS Wizard must open from the same shared wizard module as Send Message and behave identically.

Use Fillow template design only (customer portal purple). No new UI patterns, no new icons, no new styling.

Implementation Notes

Remove/undo any template-specific composer JSX that duplicates Send Message.

Import the existing Send Message composer and reuse it directly.

Only template-specific differences are via props:

Hide recipients selection

Hide pricing preview

Hide scheduling

Change primary CTA to Save Draft / Launch

Do not change layout grids, card ordering, or button positioning.

Acceptance Criteria

In Template Create/Edit → Content step:

Selecting Basic RCS shows RCS Agent dropdown exactly as Send Message.

Selecting Rich RCS shows RCS Agent dropdown and opens the same Rich RCS Wizard as Send Message.

“Improve with API”, trackable link, expiry toggles, and opt-out management appear and are positioned identically to Send Message.

A visual diff between Send Message composer and Template composer (same channel selected) should show no differences other than recipient/pricing/scheduling being hidden and CTA text changing.
