Fix and standardise the drill-down behaviour on the Finance Data page.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- As soon as I click a month, the table automatically drills by Day.
- I cannot choose the first drill dimension.
- When I drill further (e.g. Day → Sub Account), I do NOT see totals for the previous level in the same view.

REQUIRED BEHAVIOUR:

────────────────────────
A) Do NOT auto-drill by Day when a month is clicked
────────────────────────
Change the current logic so:

- Clicking a Billing Month row does NOT automatically assume "Day" as the next drill level.
- The first drill dimension must be explicitly chosen by the user.

Implementation model:
1. Add a “Drill by” control (e.g. dropdown or pill selector) ABOVE the table that lets the user choose the next drill dimension:
   - Available dimensions:
     • Day
     • Sub Account
     • Country
     • Sender ID
     • Product Type
     • Group Name

2. Drill only occurs when BOTH are true:
   - A month row is clicked
   - A drill dimension is selected in the “Drill by” control

If no drill dimension is selected:
- Clicking a month should do nothing (or show a small tooltip: “Select a drill dimension first”).

────────────────────────
B) First drill example – Month → Day (all days on ONE page)
────────────────────────
When the user:
- Selects “Day” in the “Drill by” control
- Clicks “September 2025”

The table layout must become:

Row 1: Month total row
- Label: “September 2025 (Totals)”
- Columns:
  • Billable Parts (sum for entire month)
  • Non-Billable Parts
  • Total Parts
  • Total Cost (ex VAT)
  • Billing Status (for that month)

Rows below: one row per day for that month:
- 01/09/2025
- 02/09/2025
- 03/09/2025
- …
- 30/09/2025

Each Day row shows:
- Billable Parts
- Non-Billable Parts
- Total Parts
- Total Cost (ex VAT)
- Billing Status (if applicable per day or inherited from month)

IMPORTANT:
- ALL days must be on ONE table view (with scrolling if needed).
- Do NOT send me to a separate page per day.

Breadcrumb example:
Finance Data → September 2025 → Day

────────────────────────
C) Second drill example – Month → Day → Sub Account (with totals)
────────────────────────
If I am at Day-level for September 2025, and I then choose “Sub Account” as the next drill dimension, the table should show:

Top:
- September 2025 (Totals)

Then, for EACH day:
- A Day total row
- Followed by Sub Account rows for that day

Example layout:

September 2025 (Totals)

01/09/2025  (Day total)
    Sub Account 1
    Sub Account 2

02/09/2025  (Day total)
    Sub Account 1
    Sub Account 3

03/09/2025  (Day total)
    Sub Account 2
    Sub Account 4

…and so on, until the end of the month.

Rules:
- The Month total row shows the sum for the whole month.
- Each Day row shows totals for that day.
- Each Sub Account row shows totals for that day + that sub account.
- All rows use the SAME billing columns:
  • Billable Parts
  • Non-Billable Parts
  • Total Parts
  • Total Cost (ex VAT)
  • Billing Status

All of this MUST be on a single scrollable table page, not multiple separate pages.

Breadcrumb example:
Finance Data → September 2025 → Day → Sub Account

────────────────────────
D) General rule – every drill level must show the parent total row
────────────────────────
For ANY drill path and level:

- The first row in the table should always be the TOTAL for the current “parent” level.
  • At Month level → Month total row.
  • After drilling by Day → first row is the Month total row, followed by Day rows.
  • After drilling by Day + Sub Account → first row is Month total, then Day totals, then Sub Account rows per day.

- When a new dimension is added to the drill:
  • Keep the previous total rows visible.
  • Add the new child rows underneath the correct parent row (with indentation or grouped styling).

The pattern is:

Level 0: Month total  
Level 1: Parent-level totals (e.g. Days)  
Level 2: Child-level breakdown (e.g. Sub Accounts under each Day)  
Level 3: Child-level breakdown under each Sub Account (if more drill dimensions are used later)

Export:
- When exporting, export exactly what is currently visible in the table (including all levels and totals), with the same grouping and totals.

────────────────────────
E) Constraints
────────────────────────
- Do NOT hard-code a specific drill order. The user chooses the drill order via the “Drill by” control.
- Do NOT disable drill for Finalised months.
- Keep using the existing Finance Data table design (no charts, no new styling system).
- Preserve existing filters and pagination/infinite scroll behaviour.

Acceptance:
- Clicking a month WITHOUT selecting a drill dimension does nothing (or prompts the user).
- Selecting “Day” then clicking a month shows: Month total + all days for that month in ONE table.
- Adding “Sub Account” as a second drill shows: Month total → each Day total → Sub Account rows under each day.
- Each drill level shows totals for the previous level in the same view.
