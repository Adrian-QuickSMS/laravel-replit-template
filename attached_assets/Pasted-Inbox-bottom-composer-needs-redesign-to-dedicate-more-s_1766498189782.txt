Inbox bottom composer needs redesign to dedicate more space to sending configuration, and it must reuse the existing “Send Message” UI template and formatting.

Goal:
- Replace the current small composer with a larger “mini Send Message” composer card that sits beneath the chat pane.
- This must look like a compact version of the Send Message screen, using the SAME components, spacing, typography, and layout patterns.

A) Layout change
- The chat history area should remain scrollable.
- Beneath the chat history, add a SINGLE card that contains the full mini composer.
- Allocate more vertical space to this composer card (so it doesn’t feel cramped).
- Do NOT create extra whitespace inside other cards/panels.

B) Mini composer card contents (must match Send Message patterns)

1) Channel picker (same as Send Message)
- Provide the same channel picker options used in Send Message:
  - SMS
  - Basic RCS
  - Rich RCS
- Availability should follow the same rules as Send Message (permissions/device capability/agent availability) — if wiring is missing, add TODO, but keep the UI.

2) Conditional “Sender” controls (same behaviour as Send Message)
- When SMS is selected:
  - Show SenderID / Reply-from dropdown (numbers assigned to account).
- When Basic RCS or Rich RCS is selected:
  - Show RCS Agent dropdown.
- Only show the relevant dropdown(s) for the selected channel type.
- Use the same dropdown component styling as Send Message.

3) Content editor card area (same as Send Message)
Inside the mini composer card include the content editor section that matches Send Message:

- Template dropdown ABOVE the text input area (same placement as Send Message).
- “Improve with AI” button inline with the Template dropdown (same row).
- Message input box styled exactly like Send Message.
- Placeholder button + emoji picker functionality present (same UX as Send Message):
  - Placeholder/insert-field control
  - Emoji icon bottom-right inside the input
  - Emoji picker must work (opens and inserts at cursor)
  - Placeholders insert at cursor position

C) Constraints
- Use existing Send Message Blade components/partials for:
  - Channel picker
  - SenderID dropdown
  - RCS Agent dropdown
  - Template dropdown
  - Improve with AI button
  - Message content editor (including placeholder + emoji)
- Do NOT redesign UI or introduce new components.
- Do NOT change styles globally.
- Limit changes to the Inbox/Messages module only.

Acceptance criteria
- The bottom composer is a larger single card beneath chat, visually consistent with Send Message.
- Channel picker behaves identically to Send Message and conditionally shows correct sender controls.
- Template dropdown + Improve with AI + content input match Send Message layout.
- Placeholder + emoji picker work and insert into the editor correctly.
