Send Message Screen — “Test Message” Button + Modal (Before Continue)

Requirement:
- Add a “Test message” button next to the existing “Continue” button on the Send Message screen.
- Purpose: allow the user to send a test message to their own handset before proceeding to the next step.

Behaviour:
1) Button placement
- Place “Test message” beside “Continue” (same row).
- Style it as a secondary action (Continue remains primary).

2) On click: open modal
- Clicking “Test message” opens a modal popup with:
  - Title: “Send a test message”
  - Field: Mobile number
    - Placeholder: “e.g. 447700900123”
    - Validation: UK mobile format supported; normalise if user enters 07… or +44…
  - Optional helper text:
    “We’ll send this message to your phone so you can preview it before continuing.”
  - Buttons:
    - Primary: “Send test”
    - Secondary: “Cancel”

3) What is sent
- The test must send the SAME message content currently configured on Screen 1:
  - If SMS selected: send SMS with current SenderID + content (including placeholders resolved using sample/defaults OR left as placeholders — choose whichever is already used in previews)
  - If Basic RCS selected: send Basic RCS (and SMS fallback if configured, following existing rules)
  - If Rich RCS selected: send the Rich RCS payload (cards/carousel/buttons/media) exactly as configured in the wizard
- Test message sends immediately (no scheduling).

4) Success / error feedback
- On success:
  - Show confirmation in the modal: “Test message sent.”
  - Keep user on Screen 1 (do not navigate).
- On failure:
  - Show a clear inline error message explaining failure.
  - Do not close modal automatically.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change the existing Continue flow.
- Do NOT require the user to press Continue to send a test.
- Reuse existing send APIs/endpoints where possible (a dedicated “test” flag is fine if needed).
- Maintain template modal styling and validation patterns (no new modal design).

Acceptance Criteria:
- “Test message” button appears next to Continue.
- Modal collects a phone number and sends a test using the current message configuration.
- User can verify on handset, then press Continue when ready.
- Test send does not progress the campaign or create a full campaign send.
