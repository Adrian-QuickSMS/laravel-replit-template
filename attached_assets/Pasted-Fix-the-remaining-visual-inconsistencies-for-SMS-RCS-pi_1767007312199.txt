Fix the remaining visual inconsistencies for SMS/RCS pills and avatars in the Inbox / Messages UI.

IMPORTANT:
- You MUST reuse the existing tag/list pill styles and avatar styles from the Contact Book.
- Do NOT create new colours, shapes, or CSS; copy the existing design system.

A) SMS/RCS pills – use Tag/List pill formatting

Problem:
- SMS and RCS pills are still square/rectangular.

Requirement:
- Apply the SAME styling used for Tags/Lists pills in the Contact Book to all SMS/RCS pills:
  - Same rounded “pill” shape (fully rounded border radius, not square).
  - Same padding, border-radius, font size, and text alignment.
- Keep the channel colours we already defined:
  - SMS pill: green
  - RCS pill: blue
- Locations where this must be applied:
  - Conversation list (left column)
  - Chat header
  - Anywhere else SMS/RCS pills appear in Inbox/Messages

Implementation note:
- Find the component or CSS class used for Tag/List pills in the Contact Book and reuse that class/component for SMS/RCS pills, only overriding the background colour where necessary.

B) Avatar circles in chat thread – must be true circles

Problem:
- Avatar shapes in the chat thread are currently oval instead of circular (see the attached screenshot with red circles showing the issue).

Requirement:
- Ensure ALL avatars in the Inbox/Messages module are perfect circles, not ovals:
  - Height and width must be equal.
  - Use the same avatar component/styles as in the Contact Book.
  - Purple circular background.
  - White initials, bold, centred both vertically and horizontally.

Locations:
- Conversation list (left column)
- Chat thread (beside messages, where avatars are shown)
- Chat header
- Contact details panel (right sidebar)

Implementation note:
- Check for mismatched height/width or conflicting padding/line-height that might be causing the oval effect.
- Use the exact same avatar component or CSS classes as Contact Book so the behaviour and proportions are identical.

Constraints:
- Do NOT invent new avatar or pill designs.
- Reuse existing Tag/List pill and avatar components/styles from Contact Book.
- Limit changes to Inbox/Messages + shared avatar/pill components.

Acceptance checklist:
- SMS and RCS pills visually match Tag/List pills in shape and general styling (pill-shaped, not square), with correct green/blue colours.
- All avatars in Inbox/Messages are true circles, matching Contact Book exactly (same size, purple background, centered white initials).
