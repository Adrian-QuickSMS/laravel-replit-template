QuickSMS Admin Control Plane
Product Requirements Specification (Initial / Overarching Module)
1. Purpose & Positioning
1.1 What this module is

The QuickSMS Admin Control Plane is an internal-only, employee-facing super-module that provides global visibility, control, and governance across the entire QuickSMS platform.

It is designed as a superset of the customer portal, not a parallel system.

Every customer-facing module (Campaigns, Reporting, Contacts, Billing, RCS, Sender IDs, Numbers, APIs) has a corresponding admin view, but with:

Cross-client scope

Supplier-level insight

Compliance and fraud controls

Financial margin visibility

Operational override capability

1.2 What this module is NOT

❌ Not accessible to customers under any circumstance

❌ Not a duplicate UI of the customer portal

❌ Not a free-form support sandbox

❌ Not allowed to leak PII or customer audit trails unintentionally

1.3 Design philosophy (critical)

Admin is a superset, not a sibling.

This means:

Same data models

Same definitions (delivery, parts, billable, cost)

Same warehouse as source of truth

Same filters and drill logic

Extended permissions, never different logic

2. Access & Security Boundary
2.1 Hard separation

Separate authentication boundary from customer portal

Separate navigation and routing

Mandatory MFA

IP allow-listing recommended (admin-only)

2.2 Initial access model

All users are effectively Super Admin in v1

Internal RBAC is designed for, but not enforced initially

Future roles (Support, Finance, Compliance, Sales) must be structurally supported

3. Core Responsibilities of the Admin Control Plane

The Admin Control Plane must allow QuickSMS employees to:

3.1 Observe (Read)

All client traffic

All delivery outcomes

All supplier routing

All financial metrics (revenue, cost, margin)

All configuration state

3.2 Control (Write)

Approve or block:

Sender IDs

Countries

RCS Agents

Set or override:

Account status (Test / Live)

Credit limits

Dynamic sender rules

Test number allowances

Suspend / reactivate:

Accounts

APIs

Numbers

Email-to-SMS groups

3.3 Investigate (Support)

View customer configuration safely

Reproduce issues without mutating customer state

Impersonate customer UI without generating customer audit logs

Access restricted data only when explicitly allowed

3.4 Govern (Compliance)

Maintain audit logs (admin + customer-impacting)

Enforce country restrictions

Enforce anti-spam and fraud policies

Track approvals and submissions to third parties

4. Admin Module Structure (Superset Navigation)

The Admin Control Plane is composed of first-class sub-modules, each of which maps to customer functionality but extends it.

5. Shared Principles Across ALL Admin Sub-Modules

These rules apply everywhere and should be used as Replit guardrails.

5.1 Single Source of Truth

All data must come from:

Master data warehouse

Reference configuration tables

No derived metrics in UI

No local calculations beyond formatting

5.2 Filters & Drill Behaviour

Admin modules use Apply button (never auto-filter)

Every chart/table must support:

Click → drill to next-level module

No infinite nesting (max 1 level deep)

5.3 Audit Rules

Every admin action that changes customer state must log:

Admin user

Action

Target account

Before / after values

Timestamp

Support impersonation:

Logs to admin audit only

Never appears in customer audit logs

5.4 PII Protection

By default:

Phone numbers masked

Message content hidden

Personalisation fields redacted

Reveal only when:

Explicit permission

Explicit action

Explicit audit record

6. Admin Dashboard (Entry Point)

The Dashboard is the landing page and operational heartbeat.

High-level purpose:

Platform health

Revenue and margin

Delivery performance

Risk and anomaly detection

(You already have the detailed dashboard spec — this module simply owns it.)

7. Relationship to Customer Portal
Capability	Customer Portal	Admin Control Plane
Campaigns	Own only	All clients
Reporting	Own data	Cross-client + supplier
Billing	Own invoices	All invoices
Sender IDs	Request only	Approve / submit
RCS Agents	Register	Validate / submit
Numbers	Configure	Override / reassign
Audit Logs	Own	Global + internal
8. Non-Functional Requirements

Must scale to entire platform traffic

Must support:

Millions of records/day

Multi-year historical views

Must remain responsive under wide filters

All expensive queries:

Server-side aggregation

Indexed dimensions

Cached where safe

9. Replit Prompting Guidance (Important)

When breaking this into prompts:

Treat each sub-module as a child of Admin Control Plane

Enforce:

Shared filters

Shared audit model

Shared permissions model

Never allow a sub-module to invent:

New metric definitions

New delivery statuses

New billing logic
