2.6 Content – SMS & Basic RCS (Text)
Section Purpose
This section defines how text-based message content is composed, personalised, validated, and enhanced for SMS and Basic RCS (text-only) delivery.
It includes content editing, personalisation, encoding awareness, scheduling controls, and optional enhancements surfaced via toggles and pop-ups to minimise visual clutter.
Rich RCS content (cards, images, buttons) is handled separately and is only available when Rich RCS with SMS fallback is selected.
________________________________________
Visibility Rules
This section is visible when:
•	SMS only is selected, or
•	Basic RCS with SMS fallback is selected, or
•	Rich RCS with SMS fallback is selected (for SMS fallback content)
________________________________________
2.6.1 Message Content Editor
Input Control
•	Field type: Multi-line text area
•	Label (dynamic):
o	SMS Content (SMS only)
o	Message Content (Basic RCS with SMS fallback)
o	SMS Fallback Content (Rich RCS with SMS fallback)
•	Placeholder: Type your message here…
________________________________________
2.6.2 Channel-Aware Text Delivery Logic (Automatic)
The system automatically determines whether the message is sent as SMS or Basic RCS (text) based on the selected channel and message length.
Delivery Rules
SMS only
•	Message is always sent as SMS
•	GSM / Unicode segmentation rules apply
Basic RCS with SMS fallback
•	Editor is text-only
•	Delivery behaviour:
o	Messages ≤160 characters may be sent as SMS
o	Messages >160 characters are automatically delivered as a single Basic RCS text message where supported
o	SMS is used as fallback if RCS is not supported on the recipient device
•	No user action is required to enable this behaviour
Helper text (inline or tooltip):
“Messages over 160 characters will be automatically sent as a single RCS message where supported.”
Rich RCS with SMS fallback
•	This editor represents SMS fallback content only
•	Rich RCS content is configured separately
•	SMS segmentation rules apply to fallback messages
________________________________________
2.6.3 Mail Merge / Personalisation
•	Control: Insert personalisation button within the editor toolbar
•	Opens a pop-up listing available placeholders derived from:
o	Contact Book fields
o	CSV / Excel column mappings
•	Examples:
o	{{firstName}}
o	{{appointmentDate}}
o	{{customField_1}}
•	Only fields available from selected recipient sources are shown
•	Placeholders are inserted at the cursor position

2.6.4 Emoji Picker & Unicode Handling
Emoji Picker
•	Control: Emoji icon located in the bottom-right of the editor
•	Opens emoji selection library
•	Selected emoji is inserted at cursor position
________________________________________
Unicode Detection
•	If any Unicode character (including emoji) is detected:
o	Encoding switches to Unicode
o	The triggering character is visually highlighted
o	Unicode indicator is displayed next to the character counter
•	Tooltip text:
“This character causes the message to be sent using Unicode encoding.”
________________________________________
2.6.5 Character Set Detection & Counters
The system automatically detects encoding based on content.
Displayed Metrics (Real-Time)
•	Characters: X
•	Encoding: GSM-7 / Unicode
•	Segments: Y (SMS only)
________________________________________
Segmentation Rules (SMS)
GSM-7
•	160 characters (single)
•	153 characters per segment (concatenated)
Unicode
•	70 characters (single)
•	67 characters per segment (concatenated)
________________________________________
Basic RCS Text Behaviour
•	Basic RCS text messages are not segmented
•	Character count remains visible for authoring clarity
•	When content exceeds 160 characters under Basic RCS with SMS fallback:
o	A helper label is shown:
“This message will be delivered as a single RCS text message.”
