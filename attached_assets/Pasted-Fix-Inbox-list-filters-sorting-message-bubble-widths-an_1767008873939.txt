Fix Inbox list filters/sorting, message bubble widths, and pill layout/formatting. Use existing UI components and patterns; do NOT redesign.

────────────────────────
A) Filters & Sorting – add realistic mock data and make them work

Problem:
- Filters and sort controls do not appear to be working for the Inbox conversation list.
- It’s hard to validate behaviour with the current small/limited dataset.

Requirements:
1) Create/extend a mock dataset for the Inbox conversation list:
   - At least 25–50 conversation items with varied values:
     - Different contacts
     - Different SMS/RCS combinations
     - Different timestamps (new/old)
     - Different VMN/short code/RCS agent sources
     - Mix of unread/read and messages waiting for reply

2) Wire filters and sorting to this mock dataset:
   - Filters should correctly filter the list when applied.
   - Sorting options (e.g. newest, oldest, etc.) should visibly change the list order.
   - Ensure multiple filters + sort can be used together.

3) Add a clear way to confirm they are working:
   - For now, console logs or inline comments are fine (TODO: replace with real data later).

B) Chat bubbles – width logic for customer and user messages

Problem:
- Customer (inbound) chat bubbles are visually too narrow.
- They should expand naturally across the chat pane unless constrained by line breaks or a reasonable max width.

Requirements:
- Apply the SAME width logic to both:
  - Customer (inbound) messages
  - User (outbound) messages

Bubble width behaviour:
- Bubbles should expand across the chat thread up to a sensible maximum width (e.g. about 3/5 of the chat thread width, 60–70%), unless:
  - There is a manual line break in the text, or
  - The message naturally wraps due to length.
- Do NOT limit bubbles to a very narrow column or fixed small width.
- Long messages should wrap nicely within that max width.
- Short messages should still appear as normal bubbles, not tiny skinny ones.

Implementation notes:
- Check tailwind/CSS classes that might be forcing narrow widths (e.g. max-w-xs, strict flex-basis, etc.) and adjust to a wider, responsive max width.
- Ensure the width logic is applied consistently across all message types.

────────────────────────
C) Pills – shape and spacing must be uniform

Problems:
- SMS/RCS pills are still not displaying correctly.
- Spacing between:
  - Contact name
  - SMS/RCS pill
  - Time of last message
  - Notification (unread) icon
  is inconsistent/non-uniform.

Requirements:

1) Pill styling:
   - SMS/RCS pills must use the same pill style as existing Tag/List pills:
     - Rounded edges (full pill shape, not square)
     - Consistent padding and font size
   - Only the colours should differ (green for SMS, blue for RCS).

2) Horizontal spacing / alignment:
   - On each conversation row, ensure consistent spacing between:
     - Contact name
     - SMS/RCS pill
     - Timestamp
     - Unread notification icon
   - Use a consistent gap strategy (e.g. flex with gap utilities or consistent margin classes) so items do not appear squashed or randomly spaced.
   - Items should align horizontally on the same baseline where appropriate.

Implementation notes:
- Locate the existing Tag/List pill component or CSS and reuse it directly for SMS/RCS pills.
- Use a single layout pattern (e.g. flex-row + gap-x-*) for the line that holds name, pill, time, and notification.

────────────────────────
Constraints:
- Do NOT redesign the overall UI.
- Reuse existing components/styles from Messages and Contact Book (pills, typography, layout).
- Limit changes to:
  - Inbox/Messages module
  - Shared components for pills and bubbles as needed.

────────────────────────
Acceptance checklist:
- Filters and sorting are clearly working on a larger mock dataset for the Inbox list.
- Customer and user chat bubbles expand naturally up to ~3/5 of the chat width and are no longer unreasonably narrow.
- SMS/RCS pills are true pills (rounded) and visually match Tag/List pill styling.
- Spacing between contact name, pill, time, and notification icon is clean, uniform, and consistent across all rows.
