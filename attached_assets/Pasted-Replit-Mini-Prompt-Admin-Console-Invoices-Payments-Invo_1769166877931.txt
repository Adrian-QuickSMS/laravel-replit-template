Replit Mini Prompt — Admin Console > Invoices & Payments > Invoices (Global Clone)

Context
You are working in the QuickSMS Admin Console (internal-only). Build Admin → Invoices & Payments → Invoices by making an identical copy of the Customer Portal invoice module (Reporting > Invoices / Invoices UI) — same layout, same components, same table style, same filters, same actions, same modals, same pagination, same empty states, same confirmation patterns.

Hard Rule (No redesign)

Do NOT redesign anything.

Reuse the existing invoice module code/components/logic from the customer portal wherever possible (shared components).

Only allowed visual change: swap Fillow purple accents → Admin blue accents.

Do not change row colouring/status colouring other than accent highlights (keep status pill colours as-is).

Keep the same background + card styles as the customer invoice module, just with admin blue.

1) Navigation / Routing

Add route: Admin Console → Invoices & Payments → Invoices

Ensure left nav reflects this path and highlights active section.

2) Core Functional Difference (Global View)

This is a global view across all customer accounts.

Table changes

Add first column: Account Name (customer account display name).

Must be sortable A–Z / Z–A using the same table sort patterns as customer module.

Clicking Account Name should drill to that account’s admin account page (if exists), otherwise no-op for now.

Filters

Add filter: Account Name (searchable dropdown / typeahead using the same Fillow filter control style already used in admin modules).

Filtering must be Apply Filters driven (no auto filtering until Apply is clicked), matching admin filter pattern.

Everything else must remain identical to customer invoice module.

3) UI Requirements (Identical Clone)

Replicate exactly:

Page header + breadcrumb style (admin console breadcrumb format)

Summary cards/tiles (if they exist in customer invoices module)

Table header styling, column spacing, row height, pagination, export/download actions, three-dot actions, confirmation modals, empty/loading states

Status pills/badges and their colours (unchanged)

Any invoice detail view / view modal / download invoice / credit note flows (exact same UX)

Only change:

Replace purple accents (buttons, highlights, focus states, active tab indicator) with admin blue.

4) Data Model (Mock + Backend-Ready)

Use mock data if backend is not ready, but structure it so it’s drop-in replaceable with real endpoints.

Mock invoices must include accountName (string) and accountId (string) for the new column/filter.

Keep existing invoice fields exactly as customer module expects (invoice number, period, amount, status, issued date, due date, etc).

5) Column Fit & Density

Ensure all columns fit on screen like the customer module.

If needed, reduce font size slightly using existing Fillow typography scale (don’t invent new sizes).

No horizontal scroll unless customer module already uses it.

6) Acceptance Criteria

Admin Invoices page looks and behaves identically to customer invoice module (same UI/UX), except:

Admin blue accents instead of purple

First column is Account Name

Filter includes Account Name

Data scope is global (all accounts)

Apply Filters updates table correctly.

Sorting works including Account Name.

Actions/modals behave exactly like customer module.

Code uses shared components (no duplicated “new invoice UI” implementations).
