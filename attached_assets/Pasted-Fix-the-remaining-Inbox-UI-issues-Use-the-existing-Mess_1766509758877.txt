Fix the remaining Inbox UI issues. Use the existing Messages UI template styles/components only. Do NOT redesign.

A) Composer must be truly fixed to bottom of viewport (WhatsApp/iMessage behaviour)
Problem: composer is still moving up/down depending on chat length.
Requirement:
- The composer must be anchored to the bottom of the browser viewport at all times (position: fixed or the template’s equivalent).
- It must NOT be part of the scrollable chat container.
- Only the chat history pane should scroll behind/above it.

Implementation notes:
- Make the central chat area a flex column with:
  1) Chat header (fixed at top of chat pane)
  2) Chat messages area (flex-1, overflow-y: auto)
  3) Composer (fixed to viewport bottom, or sticky within pane with a non-scrolling parent)
- Add bottom padding to the chat messages scroll area equal to composer height so the last message isn’t hidden behind the fixed composer.
- Do not make the whole page scroll; only left list and chat history should scroll.

Acceptance:
- On long chats, composer stays pinned at the bottom of the screen.
- Messages scroll independently.
- Last message remains visible and not covered.

B) Avatars styling
Requirement:
- Replace the current white/grey avatars with:
  - Purple filled circle background
  - White initials text
- Apply consistently to:
  - Conversation list avatars
  - Chat header avatar
  - Any contact avatar shown in the right panel

Constraints:
- Use the template’s accent purple (do not invent a new colour token). Reuse an existing “primary”/“brand” colour class.

C) SMS/RCS indicator in the left inbox list (reduce clutter)
Requirement:
- The “RCS” (and SMS) indicator next to the person name is cluttered.
- Replace it with a compact pill/badge style label for channel:
  - “SMS” pill
  - “RCS” pill
- Badge styling must match existing pill/badge components in the template.
- Keep it visually secondary to the contact name (smaller, subtle), and align consistently across rows.

D) Contact details toggle removal
Current state: Contact details is always visible and the toggle no longer works.
Requirement:
- Remove the toggle / control entirely (e.g., three-dot toggle or any UI element used to show/hide the right panel).
- Keep the Contact Details panel permanently visible (no collapse behaviour required).
- Ensure layout spacing looks correct after removing the toggle (no empty gaps).

Constraints:
- Do NOT redesign layout or introduce new UI patterns.
- Only adjust positioning/styling needed for the above.
- Limit changes to Inbox/Messages files.

Acceptance checklist:
- Composer is fixed to viewport bottom like WhatsApp/iMessage and never moves with chat length.
- Avatars are purple circles with white initials everywhere.
- SMS/RCS labels are neat pills/badges and no longer clutter the name line.
- Contact details toggle is removed; right panel remains always visible and layout remains clean.
