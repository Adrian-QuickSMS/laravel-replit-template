The last change to scrolling has broken the Inbox layout – sections are misaligned and scrolling is worse than before. Please FIX this by doing the following in order.

STEP 1 – REVERT LAYOUT TO TEMPLATE BEHAVIOUR
- Restore the overall page layout for Inbox/Messages to match the existing application layout template.
- The Inbox page should use the SAME base layout structure as:
  - The Send Message screen, or
  - Any other standard two/three-column screen in this app.
- Do NOT keep any custom layout or scroll hacks added from the last prompt if they conflict with the app template.
- Make sure sections are back in the correct positions:
  - Left: conversation list
  - Centre: chat thread + composer
  - Right: contact details (if visible)

Only once the layout visually matches the standard app style again, move to Step 2.

STEP 2 – SIMPLE, CONTROLLED SCROLL BEHAVIOUR

Goal:
- Use the NORMAL app layout.
- Only allow vertical scroll inside:
  - Left conversation list
  - Centre chat thread
- The rest of the page should keep its default template behaviour, not custom scroll hacks.

Implementation rules:
1. Main page:
   - Use the app’s standard content container (as per other pages).
   - Do NOT set weird global overflow or non-standard 100vh hacks on html/body.
   - If the template already handles height, follow that pattern.

2. Left column (Inbox list):
   - Wrap the list in a container with `overflow-y: auto` so the list itself scrolls when long.
   - Height should be the usable vertical space between header and composer (if composer overlaps).

3. Centre column (chat thread):
   - Chat messages container should:
     - Fill the vertical space between the header and the composer.
     - Use `overflow-y: auto` so messages scroll INSIDE this area.
   - The composer must remain visually anchored under the chat thread, as per the template (sticky or flex bottom), not floating in the middle of the page.

4. DO NOT:
   - Do NOT disable page scroll globally if the template relies on it.
   - Do NOT move the composer outside the main chat container if that breaks alignment.
   - Do NOT change header/footer layout.

STEP 3 – CHAT BUBBLE WIDTH (KEEP IT SIMPLE)
- Fix the width of bubbles so they no longer look tiny.
- For both inbound and outbound messages:
  - Let bubbles grow up to a sensible max width (approx. 60–70% of the chat area).
  - Use a simple Tailwind/CSS approach like `max-w-[60%]` or similar on the bubble container.
  - Remove any very narrow max-width classes (e.g. `max-w-xs` or similar).
- Short messages should appear as normal-sized bubbles, not 1–2 word narrow strips.

STEP 4 – FILTERS MUST STILL WORK
- Ensure the previous filter/search logic remains intact:
  - All / Unread / SMS / RCS
  - All Sources / Short Codes / VMNs / RCS Agents
  - Search by name or mobile
- DO NOT remove or break existing working filters while fixing layout/scroll.

CONSTRAINTS
- Reuse the existing app layout template and standard column layout.
- No new global CSS or layout system.
- Only adjust:
  - Inbox/Messages layout wrappers
  - Scrollable containers for left and centre columns
  - Bubble width classes

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
- Page sections are back in the correct positions and aligned like other screens.
- Left column scrolls independently when the list is long.
- Chat thread scrolls independently when there are many messages.
- Composer sits in the right place under the chat and does NOT float halfway up.
- Bubbles are a sensible width (around 3/5 of the chat area), not skinny.
- Filters and search still work as before.
