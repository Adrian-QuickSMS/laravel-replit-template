EMAIL-TO-SMS UI CONSISTENCY FIX

Context:
This is a UI refactor for the Email-to-SMS module.
Do NOT introduce new layouts, colours, buttons, or behaviours.
Follow existing Fillow template patterns exactly (same as Message Logs, API Connections).

────────────────────────
A) Filter & Search Bar Placement (All Email-to-SMS Tabs)
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Search bar must always appear on the LEFT side of the toolbar.
- Filter button(s) must always appear on the RIGHT side of the toolbar.
- This placement must be consistent across all Email-to-SMS tabs.

Clear All behaviour:
- “Clear all” must:
  - Reset all filters to their default state
  - NOT automatically re-run the query
  - Require the user to press “Apply Filters” to refresh results
- Behaviour must match Message Logs filter logic exactly.

Acceptance:
- Toolbar layout matches Message Logs.
- Clear All has predictable, non-destructive behaviour.

────────────────────────
B) Button Cleanup
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- Remove the “+ Create Address” button entirely.
- Do NOT replace it with an alternative CTA.

Acceptance:
- No “Create Address” button exists anywhere in Email-to-SMS UI.

────────────────────────
C) Tab Naming & Order (Important)
────────────────────────
Tabs must appear in the following order ONLY:

1. Email-to-SMS Address  
   - Renamed label: “Overview”

2. Standard Email-to-SMS  
   - Renamed label: “Email-to-SMS – Standard”

3. Email-to-SMS – Contact List  
   - Do NOT rename

4. Reporting Groups  
   - Do NOT rename

Constraints:
- Do not add or remove tabs.
- Only rename exactly as specified.

Acceptance:
- Tab order and naming exactly match the list above.

────────────────────────
D) Create Reporting Group CTA
────────────────────────
Requirement:
- “+ Create Reporting Group” button text must be changed to:
  → “+ Create”
- Button styling must remain unchanged (primary Fillow CTA).

Acceptance:
- CTA label reads “+ Create” only.

Or generate a single master Email-to-SMS refactor prompt so Replit stops drifting across tabs
