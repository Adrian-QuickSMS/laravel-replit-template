ADMIN DASHBOARD — ALIGN REPORTING COMPONENTS WITH CUSTOMER DASHBOARD (NO NEW UI)

Context
- We are working in the QuickSMS Admin Control Plane (internal only).
- The Admin Dashboard MUST reuse the SAME reporting components, layout rules, and calculation logic as the CUSTOMER Reporting Dashboard.
- Do NOT redesign charts/tables. Do NOT introduce new layouts, icons, colours, or new data definitions.
- Theme may be Admin Blue, but component composition, typography, table styles, pills, headings, spacing MUST remain Fillow-standard and match customer dashboard patterns.

Global Non-Negotiables
- Use the same warehouse/API metric definitions as customer reporting:
  - Sent/Delivered/Undelivered/Pending/Rejected/Expired (use the same mapping as customer reporting).
  - Parts/fragments as the unit where customer dashboard uses parts.
- Do NOT use mock data for charts/tables that exist in customer reporting. These must be driven by the same data source + queries as customer reporting.
- Filters must only apply on “Apply Filters” (no auto-apply).

Task 1 — “Message Sent” Graph MUST match customer
Issue
- Admin “Sent” graph currently looks different and/or uses mock data.
Requirement
- Replace Admin “Sent” graph implementation with the exact same chart component used in the customer Reporting Dashboard.
- Use the same series, toggles, axis behaviour, and time bucketing rules (hourly for Today / daily for longer ranges) as customer.
- Data source must match customer reporting API/warehouse aggregates (no mock data).
Acceptance
- Graph is visually and functionally identical to the customer “Message Sent” graph (aside from blue theme).
- Values match customer reporting output when filters are equivalent.

Task 2 — “Delivery Status Breakdown” MUST match customer
Issue
- Delivery status breakdown is not matching customer and/or uses mock data.
Requirement
- Reuse the customer dashboard “Delivery Status Breakdown” component and logic (pie/donut + legend exactly as customer).
- Data must come from the same source as customer (no mock data).
Acceptance
- Same layout, labels, ordering, tooltip behaviour, and percentages as customer dashboard.
- Status mapping identical to customer.

Task 3 — “Top 10 SenderIDs” MUST match customer (design + logic)
Issue
- Admin Top 10 SenderIDs uses different design/logic.
Requirement
- Reuse the customer dashboard Top SenderIDs component (table or bar/table hybrid, whichever customer uses).
- Use the same ranking logic (by volume default) and same formatting rules as customer.
- Ensure SenderID predictive search and rendering are consistent with customer dashboard (no new UI).
Acceptance
- Pixel/structure matches customer version.
- Ranking and values match customer reporting when filters match.

Task 4 — “Top 10 Countries” MUST match customer (design + logic)
Issue
- Admin Top 10 Countries not matching customer.
Requirement
- Reuse the customer dashboard Top Countries component and logic.
- Use same country naming/ISO mapping used in customer reporting.
- No mock data.
Acceptance
- Same design and value logic as customer.

Task 5 — Supplier Route Health section changes (simplify + one full-width tile)
Remove
- Remove Route Distribution tile/graph entirely.
- Remove Supplier Pricing Reference tile/graph entirely.
Requirement (replace Supplier Route Health with ONE full-width tile)
- Create ONE full-width Fillow card/tile (spans page width) named “Supplier Route Health”.
- Inside the tile, show:
  A) Delivery status volumes + percentages:
     - Delivered, Pending, Expired, Rejected
     - Each must show: Volume + % of total (same % formatting rules as customer breakdown)
  B) Response time stats (same definition as existing admin spec, but simplified):
     - Average response time
     - Min response time
     - Max response time
- Data must come from warehouse/API (no mock).
- Use existing status pill/badge styles only (pastel Fillow style). Do not invent new pill colours.
Acceptance
- Supplier Route Health is a single page-width tile.
- Shows Delivered/Pending/Expired/Rejected volumes and %.
- Shows Avg/Min/Max response times.
- No route distribution chart exists.
- No supplier pricing tile exists.

Task 6 — UK Network & Porting Health enhancement
Current
- UK Network & Porting Health section is good.
Change required
- For “Delivery by UK Mobile Network”:
  - Keep the existing stacked status view if present, BUT add a horizontal mini line chart next to EACH network row.
  - Each network row must show a small horizontal line chart segmented by message status (Delivered/Pending/Expired/Rejected) over time.
  - The mini charts MUST use the same chart styling conventions as the customer dashboard (scaled down), and must not introduce a new chart style.
  - The porting toggle must change attribution (Original vs Ported-to) for BOTH the summary and the mini charts.
Acceptance
- Each network row shows a compact horizontal time series segmented by status.
- Porting toggle updates the attribution consistently across the entire section.
- Visual style remains Fillow-consistent (no new chart chrome).

Final checks (must do)
- Verify Admin uses the same components as customer for:
  - Sent graph
  - Delivery status breakdown
  - Top 10 SenderIDs
  - Top 10 Countries
- Remove any remaining mock data wiring for these shared reporting components.
- Ensure no redesign occurred (only reuse and composition).
