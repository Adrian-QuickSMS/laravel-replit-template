PROMPT 1 — Admin > Accounts > [Customer] > Billing (Icon/Tab) — New Customer-Scoped Billing Page (UI + Data Wiring)
Build a new page in the Admin Console: Admin > Accounts > {accountId} > Billing (accessible via a Billing icon/tab on the customer account page).
Hard rules:
- Use ONLY existing Fillow components and patterns (same typography, spacing, tables, modals, pills).
- Admin styling = blue accents only. Do NOT redesign components. Do NOT change coloured row logic.
- This page is ALWAYS customer-scoped (must load using a single accountId from route params).
Page layout:
1) Header (customer context)
- Customer Name
- Account ID (small text)
- Status pill: Live / Test / Suspended
- Billing mode pill: Prepaid / Postpaid
- Optional external link button: “View in HubSpot” (opens new tab; placeholder URL ok)
2) Billing Summary Bar (thin horizontal stat bar like existing portal summary bars)
Displayed left-to-right with thin dividers:
- Billing Mode (pill)
- Current Balance (£)
- Credit Limit (£) (editable later prompt)
- Available Credit (£) computed:
  - If Prepaid: Available Credit = Current Balance
  - If Postpaid: Available Credit = Current Balance + Credit Limit
- Account Status pill (Active/Suspended OR reuse Live/Test/Suspended; keep consistent with existing admin pills)
- Last Updated timestamp
3) Main content cards
- Billing settings card (for Billing Type + Credit Limit controls in later prompts)
- Customer invoices table card (must reuse the same invoices table component as Admin > Invoices & Payments > Invoices, but filtered to this customer)
Data sources (stub if needed):
- HubSpot is source of truth for Billing Mode + Credit Limit (use a mock service for now; must be easy to replace with real API).
- Internal billing system provides Current Balance + Last Updated (mock ok).
Acceptance:
- Page renders with mock data for a chosen accountId.
- Summary bar values display correctly and Available Credit calculation works.
- No new UI patterns invented.
