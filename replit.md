# QuickSMS Web Application

## Overview
QuickSMS is a Laravel-based SMS messaging platform designed for comprehensive communication management. It provides a user-friendly solution for messages, contacts, reporting, purchasing, and account administration, leveraging the Fillow SaaS Admin template for a modern UI. The project aims to be a powerful and intuitive platform for effective communication.

## User Preferences
The user prefers detailed explanations when new concepts or features are introduced. The user wants the agent to prioritize developing the UI and front-end interactions before implementing backend logic. When making changes, the agent should clearly mark areas requiring backend integration with `TODO` comments. The user prefers an iterative development approach, focusing on completing one module's UI before moving to the next.

## System Architecture
QuickSMS is built with PHP 8.1+ and Laravel 10, utilizing the Fillow SaaS Admin Template (Bootstrap 5) and MetisMenu for UI/UX. It uses Laravel Blade templating with a consistent `layouts.quicksms` structure and a shared pastel color scheme.

**UI/UX and Design Decisions:**
- **Navigation:** Responsive sidebar with active route highlighting.
- **Data Tables:** Standardized patterns with client-side filtering, search, pagination, and actions.
- **Forms & Modals:** Consistent use for various workflows.
- **Interactive Elements:** Mobile number masking, dynamic validation, real-time character counting.
- **Content Editor:** Enhanced with personalization, emoji support, AI assistance, and channel-aware behavior.
- **Color Scheme:** Portal-wide standardization using `public/css/quicksms-pastel.css`.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
- **Dashboard:** Operational overview, RCS promotion, support, and notifications.
- **Messages:** Features for sending, an Inbox with a three-panel conversation workspace (conversation list, chat pane, contact info sidebar), and Campaign History. Inbox supports Rich RCS message rendering directly in the chat thread.
  - **Test Message Feature:** "Test Message" button on Send Message page (next to Continue) opens a modal to send the currently configured message to a phone number for preview before proceeding. Supports all channels (SMS, Basic RCS, Rich RCS), validates UK mobile format (07.../+44.../447...), includes inline success/error feedback, and uses the same message content/payload configured on Screen 1. API call structure documented as TODO.
- **Contact Book:** Management of contacts, lists (static/dynamic), tags, and opt-out lists.
- **Reporting:** Dashboard with customizable KPI tiles and charts (ApexCharts), detailed Message Log, Finance Data, Invoices (HubSpot API), and Download Area. Invoices page displays read-only HubSpot data, including a persistent financial summary and a detail drawer.
  - **Download Area:** Repository of previously generated exports with filters (Year, Month, Module, Sub-account multi-select, User) and a results table showing filename, module, format, size, generated/expires dates, status, and download/delete actions. Filters do NOT auto-apply; data refresh occurs only on "Apply Filters" click. Includes "Reset Filters" action. Supports bulk selection and deletion. Role-restricted to Admin, Finance, and Reporting/Analytics roles. No export logic - scaffold only with TODO markers for API integration.
    - **Table columns:** Report Name, Module, Sub-account, Generated By, Date Generated, File Type, File Size (MB), Status (text only), Actions (three-dot menu with Download/Details/Delete).
    - **Report naming:** {Module} – {Date Range} – {Timestamp} format when no custom name provided.
    - **Sorting:** All columns sortable with visual indicators (ascending/descending arrows).
    - **Pagination:** Configurable page size (10/25/50/100) with page navigation.
- **Purchase:** Functionality for purchasing messages and numbers (Admin/Finance/Messaging Managers only) with HubSpot Products API for live pricing and Stripe for payment processing. Includes "Pay Invoice" and "Top Up Balance" flows with Stripe Checkout for PCI DSS compliance and comprehensive audit logging.
  - **Purchase Numbers:** Page for acquiring dedicated numbers with full audit logging and concurrency control. Two sections:
    - Virtual Mobile Numbers (VMNs): UK Long Code, International VMN, Toll-Free Number options
    - Shortcode Keywords: Shared Shortcode, Dedicated Shortcode, Premium Rate Shortcode options
    - Shared Shortcode Keywords section: Displays read-only shared shortcode (82228), keyword table with columns (Keyword, Status, Select), search functionality, A-Z/Z-A sorting, multi-select for available keywords only, taken keywords visible but disabled
    - Custom keyword input with real-time validation: alphanumeric only, no spaces, 3-20 characters (configurable), case-insensitive uniqueness check, inline error messages for invalid input, availability check before selection
    - Keyword purchase flow: Sub-account selector (mandatory), "Purchase Keywords" button, confirmation modal with keyword count/setup/monthly fees, balance validation, atomic transaction constraint
    - VMN Available Numbers table with columns: Mobile Number, Country (flag + name + ISO), Setup Fee, Monthly Fee, Availability status, Select checkbox
    - Table features: Search by number, country filter dropdown, sortable columns (asc/desc), multi-select with "Select All" for available numbers only, selection summary with total costs
    - Reserved numbers are greyed out and cannot be selected
    - Mock data with `hubspotProductId` field for future HubSpot Products API integration
    - Sub-Account selector (mandatory): Permission-aware dropdown above table, determines ownership of selected numbers, one sub-account per purchase
    - Purchase flow: "Purchase Selected Numbers" button (disabled until sub-account selected and numbers chosen), confirmation modal with billing summary (setup fee charged immediately, monthly fee on 1st of each month), explicit confirmation required
    - Insufficient balance handling: Pre-purchase validation blocks purchase if account balance is insufficient, shows modal with current balance, required amount, and shortfall, CTA links to Purchase → Messages (no auto-redirect)
    - Atomic transaction constraint: All actions succeed or fail together (no partial purchases)
    - UI-only scaffold with TODO markers for purchase logic integration
- **Management:** RCS Agent/SMS SenderID registrations, Templates, API Connections, Email-to-SMS, and Number management.
- **Account:** Details, User/Access management, Sub Accounts, Audit Logs, and Security settings.
- **Support:** Dashboard, Ticket creation, and Knowledge Base.
- **Unified RCS Wizard:** Shared fullscreen modal component (`rcs-wizard-modal.blade.php`) and JavaScript (`rcs-wizard.js`) for creating rich RCS messages, used across Send Message and Inbox pages.
- **RCS Preview System:** Schema-driven renderer (`/rcs/preview-demo`) with an Android-style phone UI for channel-specific previews (Rich RCS, Basic RCS, SMS). Supports mock RCS agents with brand icons.
- **RCS Asset Management:** Server-side image processing for RCS media, handling URL-based and uploaded images with transformations (zoom, crop, orientation) using Intervention Image. Features include SSRF protection, dedicated storage, `RcsAsset` model for tracking, and an explicit save workflow for URL images with interactive drag-to-position crop editor.
- **MessageLog Model:** Defines message structure with encrypted content and role-based access.
- **Development Environment:** Utilizes SQLite for local development.
- **CSS Architecture:** Module-specific CSS overrides Fillow styles with unique prefixes.
